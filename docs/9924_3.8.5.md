- Notify invocations when a member leaves in FROZEN/PASSIVE cluster state. [[#11202]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11202/)
- The client should not use localhost if it is not explicitly configured and the discovery is configured. [[#11199]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11199/)
- Query cache fix for map destroy. [[#11197]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11197/)

- Add forgotten public address check from cache. [[#11169]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11169/)
- `CacheDestroyOperation` must be invoked from generic operation thread. [[#11165]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11165/)
- `RemoveOperation` returns old value causing `SerializationException` in WAN replication when sources are not available and the store type is binary. [[#11157]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11157/)
- Error in Spring configuration: "`${hazelcast.queue.capacity}` is not a valid value for 'integer". The property `queue-capacity`'s type should be changed. [[#11150]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11150/)

- An exception can't be rethrown from a different thread; it will lead to exceptions with very obscure stacktraces. [[#11022]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11022/)
