- `ClassCastException` is thrown when the method `MultiMap.get()` is run. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/256" target="_blank">[256]</a>
- Currently, the method `MultiMap.get(K key)` returns null if there are no values associated with the key. However, it should return an empty collection instead. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/167" target="_blank">[167]</a>
