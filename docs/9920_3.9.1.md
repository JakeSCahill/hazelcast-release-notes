The following are fixed issues and enhancements for Hazelcast 3.9.1 release.

- `MulticastJoiner` may cause `OutOfMemoryException` due to the self-amplification in `SplitBrainJoinMessage` sending. [[#11836]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11836)
- Dynamic configuration added on the lite member is not found after a Split-Brain healing. [[#11815]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11815)
- Client transactions does not respect to unisocket behavior. [[#11802]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11802)
- Incorrect null log message in `DelegatingAddressPicker`. [[#11783]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11783)
- A high number of `EntryEventType[]` is created in a client application which receives many entry events. In a specific application, `EntryEventType[]` dominates the application's overall memory allocation. [[#11777]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11777)
- Hazelcast client fails to connect to the cluster if the first cluster member is down. [[#11735]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11735)
- After promoting a member (`HazelcastInstance.getCluster().promoteLocalLiteMember()`) the instance of the member retrieved by `getMembers()` is not updated. [[#11720]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11720)
- Enqueued item gets lost when the client stops and reconnects sooner than `hazelcast.client.endpoint.remove.delay.seconds`. [[#11700]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11700)
- While trying to setup Hazelcast on AWS, the order of member initialization is wrong. [[#11681]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11681)
- Query cache on an IMap that is subsequently destroyed and recreated does not work. [[#11666]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11666)
- The method `DefaultQueryCache::getAll` does not check for null values. [[#11665]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11665)
- When the method `HazelcastInstance.shutdown()` is called, the following error is thrown: "Could not retrieve ringbuffer service to destroy event journal". [[#11662]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11662)
- Defining management center in the configuration causes partition migrations even though there is no data. [[#11598]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11598)
- Weird Split-Brain like issue with Hazelcast 3.8.4. [[#11533]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11533)
- Consider logging new HTTP connections with DEBUG or lower level. [[#11196]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11196)
- `HashSet` and `HashMap` are initialized with a too small size. [[#9445]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9445)




##### Coverity Fixes

- Dereference null return value in the method`ClientConnectionManagerImpl.encodeAuthenticationRequest()`. [[#11767]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11767)
- Using invalid iterator in the method `SmartClientListenerService.deregisterListenerInternal(String)`. [[#11760]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11760)
- Resource leak in client's `ProxyManager`. [[#11751]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11751)
