## Enhancements

- **Ping Failure Detector for Hazelcast Java Client:** Ping Failure Detector provides a quicker and more deterministic detection of hardware and other lower level events. It has been available for Hazelcast members; now, it can also be used for Hazelcast Java clients. The related PR is [[#12049]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12049). Please see the [Client Ping Failure Detector section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9.3/manual/html-single/index.html#client-ping-failure-detector).

## Fixes

- Hazelcast client throws "AuthenticationException: Invalid credentials after owner member left". Clients should detect when a member is gone ungracefully.[[#12038]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12038)
- Query results should be converted to OBJECT in-memory format while creating the query-result-set, if the transaction is not originated from the client. [[#12050]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12050)
