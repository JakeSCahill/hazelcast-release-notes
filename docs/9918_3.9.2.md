## Enhancements

- Expiration operations can be stopped/canceled during the `SHUTTING_DOWN` state. Otherwise it causes graceful shutdowns which take longer, especially on clusters with a large amount of data, e.g., High-Density Memory Store backed maps. It is not necessary to block the shutdown for these operations since it will eventually be handled on the new owner of the entries. [[#11919]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11919)



## Fixes

- `PartitionPredicate` on `MapAggregation` throws exception when it is called from the client. [[#11923]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11923)
- Some client `TransactionalMap` operations deserializes on the server side, while `IMap.values()` does not do so. This causes serialization exceptions on a client-member setup when members do not have the serialization information, e.g., in case where portables are used. [[#11885]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11885)
- Replicated map's Javadoc contains only member behaviors/requirements which the client cannot meet due to its technical difference. [[#11707]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11707)
- Ringbuffer access throws HazelcastInstanceNotActiveException when cluster state is PASSIVE. [[#11664]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11664)




##### Coverity Fixes

- The method `addressTranslator.translate(target)` of `com.hazelcast.client.connection.nio.ClientConnectionManagerImpl.InitConnectionTask.run()` may return null. The returned value is used as an argument for the method `createSocketConnection(Address)` which uses the value without a null-check. [[#11771]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11771)
