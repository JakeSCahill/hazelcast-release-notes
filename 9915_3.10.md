This section lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for 3.10 release. Note that all the Hazelcast IMDG Open Source features and enhancements are also included in the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise edition by default.

## New Features


##### Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Features

- **TLS Hostname Validation**: Added hostname validation support for X.509 certificates as defined in IETF's [RFC625](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125). Using this feature, you can allow SSL/TLS connections only with the hosts which have a matching hostname entry in the certificate. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???).


## Enhancements



##### Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements


- **Split-Brain Healing for Hazelcast Data Structures with High-Density (HD) Memory Store**: Added implementations to allow the merging of HD Memory Store backed data structures. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.
- **Multiple Users/Roles in a Single Security Mapping**: Added support for allowing multiple principals, i.e., users or roles/groups, to be attributed to a security realm. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.



##### Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements

- **Extended Split-Brain Protection**: Split-Brain protection has been implemented for all the Hazelcast data structures (it was only for IMap, ICache, IQueue and ILock before 3.10). Please see the [Distributed Data Structures chapter](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#distributed-data-structures).
- **Shorter Split-Brain Detection Window**: In addition to the current quorum function, which uses the list of members to determine whether a minimum number of members is available in the cluster, a new quorum implementation has been introduced to shorten the time between the occurrence of a network partitioning and its detection: it takes advantage of information about the cluster health (heartbeats and ICMP pings). Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.
- **Extended Merge Policies**: Merge policies applied after a Split-Brain syndrome has been implemented for more Hazelcast data structures (it was for IMap, ICache and Replicated Map before 3.10). Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.
- **Reliable IdGenerator**: Introduced to overcome the duplicate ID generation in case of a network split, by the deprecated `IdGenerator` data structure. Please see the [Reliable IdGenerator section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#reliable-idgenerator).
- **CRDT OR-Set**: Introduced the OR-Set which is a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). As an alternative to Hazelcast's ISet, the OR-Set (Observed-Removed Set) allows multiple adds and removes. Please see the [CRDT OR-Set section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#crdt-or-set).
- **CRDT PN-Counter**: Introduced another CRDT, i.e., PN-Counter (Positive-Negative Counter), which allows incrementing and decrementing a counter value and propagating the results to all cluster members. Please see the [CRDT PN-Counter section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#crdt-pn-counter).
- **Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation**: Implemented Raft Consensus Algorithm for Hazelcast's atomic data structures, such as IAtomicLong, ILock and IAtomicReference, to make them CP (Consistency/Partition Tolerance) data structures on top of Hazelcast. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???). 





The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- The `CharConverter` conversion behavior should be improved: When given an empty string, `IllegalArgumentException` should be thrown instead of the obscure `StringIndexOutOfBoundsException`. Also, when given a `Number`, a `Character` should be returned instead of an `Integer`. [[#11981]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11981)
- The Javadoc for IMap must be enhanced to clarify the value vs. reference semantics. [[#11816]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11816)
- The class `com.hazelcast.query.Predicates` contains public factory methods for query predicates. Most of the methods are missing Javadoc. [[#11734]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11734)
- The value of Main-Class in `hazelcast-all.jar` should be fixed. The class `StartServer` should be used instead of `ConsoleApp`. Currently, when the JAR is executed, the ConsoleApp demo application is started. [[#11655]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11655)
- The error message for failed client connections should not talk about "address in the config" as multicast discovery may have been used. [[#11652]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11652)
- Doing a rolling upgrade without a Hazelcast Enterprise key should produce a better error message. [[#11602]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11602)

## Fixes


- Hazelcast should not allow to add dynamic configurations for concurrent data structures during rolling upgrades: new configurations have been introduced for `IAtomicLong` and `IAtomicReference` for the split-brain healing. There may come more for the split-brain protection; these should not be added dynamically when the cluster is on version 3.9, since old members will fail to process them. [[#12000]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12000)
- Using `MemberAddressProvider` with custom discovery strategy SPI does not seem to work. [[#11997]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11997)
- The objects `BufferObjectDataInput` and `BufferObjectDataOutput` are pooled. While being used for serialization, their version may be set, however when cleared (so they can be returned to the pool), their version is not reset to `UNKNOWN`. [[#11900]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11900)
- The default network interface selection chooses a wrong interface in some cases. [[#11795]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11795)
- The memory limit setting for a queue store is ignored and the entries are getting inserted into both the store and the queue, even If the limit is reached. [[#11682]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11682)
- When trying to integrate Spring and Hazelcast with MapStore implementation, the JdbcTemplate cannot be autowired in the MapStore class. [[#11656]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11656)
- The `Echo` task used to execute the operations demo in `ConsoleApp` fails to deserialize because of missing no-arg constructor. [[#11612]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11612)
- Wrong Hazelcast configuration XSD schema is used when minor/major or minor has more than 1 digit (e.g., 3.1x). [[#11586]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11586)
- The XSD (`hazelcast-spring.xsd`) should work independently of the `hazelcast-spring.jar`. [[#11577]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11577)
- It does not seem to be possible to configure a list of cipher suites nor a list of SSL/TLS protocols. Client authorization is implemented, but it has to be passed in a populated `Properties` object. [[#10750]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10750)
- Transaction could not obtain a lock for the key while calling the method `TransactionalMap.getForUpdate()`. [[#9374]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9374)
- JCache fails to initialize when the type of a key or value is not available on a remote member. [[#8972]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8972)
- IMap JMX statistics are evicted together with the map entry: When system starts and caches are populated,  and get the hits, the statistics presents the relevant values for `localHits` and `localGetOperationCount` attributes. But after 1 hour of idle and some entries are evicted, these attributes become less and less, till 0. Looks like these statistics are stored together with the entry itself and they are evicted together with the entry. [[#4321]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4321)

#### Coverity Fixes

- The methods `readObject(...)` and `writeObject(...)` should call the method from the superclass instead of handling the `attributeName` field themselves in the classes `LikePredicate` and `RegexPredicate`. [[#11768]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11768)
- The field `retryCounter` is not atomically updated in the method `RestartingMemberIterator.retry(Set)`. [[#11750]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11750)



## Behavioral Changes

- Edge-case behavior of `findXConfig` methods in the `Config` class changed and methods are more consistent now. The method `findCacheConfig` now behaves similarly to other `findXConfig` methods. PR 11780 ???
- ???

## Removed/Deprecated Features

- The data structure `IdGenerator` is deprecated. It could produce duplicate IDs in case of a network split, even with split-brain protection being enabled. Use [Flake ID Generator](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#flakeidgenerator) for an alternative implementation which does not suffer from the mentioned issue.
- The system properties `hazelcast.master.confirmation.interval.seconds` and `hazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds` are deprecated.
