This section lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for 3.10 release. Note that all the Hazelcast IMDG Open Source features and enhancements are also included in the Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise edition by default.

## New Features


##### Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Features

- **TLS Hostname Validation**: Added hostname validation support for X.509 certificates as defined in IETF's [RFC625](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6125). Using this feature, you can allow SSL/TLS connections only with the hosts which have a matching hostname entry in the certificate. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???).


## Enhancements



##### Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements


- **Split-Brain Healing for Hazelcast Data Structures with High-Density (HD) Memory Store**: Added implementations to allow the merging of HD Memory Store backed data structures. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.
- **Multiple Users/Roles in a Single Security Mapping**: Added support for allowing multiple principals, i.e., users or roles/groups, to be attributed to a security realm. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.



##### Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements

- **Extended Split-Brain Protection**: Split-Brain protection has been implemented for all the Hazelcast data structures (it was only for IMap, ICache, IQueue and ILock before 3.10). Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???).
- **Shorter Split-Brain Detection Window**: In addition to the current quorum function, which uses the list of members to determine whether a minimum number of members is available in the cluster, a new quorum implementation has been introduced to shorten the time between the occurrence of a network partitioning and its detection: it takes advantage of information about the cluster health (heartbeats and ICMP pings). Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.
- **Extendend Merge Policies**: Merge policies applied after a Split-Brain syndrome has been implemented for more Hazelcast data structures (it was for IMap, ICache and Replicated Map before 3.10). Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???) for more information.
- **Reliable IdGenerator**: Introduced to overcome the duplicate ID generation in case of a network split, by the deprecated `IdGenerator` data structure. Please see the [Reliable IdGenerator section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#reliable-idgenerator).
- **CRDT OR-Set**: Introduced the OR-Set which is a Conflict-Free Replicated Data Type (CRDT). As an alternative to Hazelcast's ISet, the OR-Set (Observed-Removed Set) allows multiple adds and removes. Please see the [CRDT OR-Set section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#crdt-or-set).
- **CRDT PN-Counter**: Introduced another CRDT, i.e., PN-Counter (Positive-Negative Counter), which allows incrementing and decrementing a counter value and propagating the results to all cluster members. Please see the [CRDT PN-Counter section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#crdt-pn-counter).
- **Raft Consensus Algorithm Implementation**: Implemented Raft Consensus Algorithm for Hazelcast's atomic data structures, such as IAtomicLong, ILock and IAtomicReference, to make them CP (Consistency/Partition Tolerance) data structures on top of Hazelcast. Please see the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#???).

## Fixes

## Behavioral Changes

- Edge-case behavior of `findXConfig` methods in the `Config` class changed and methods are more consistent now. The method `findCacheConfig` now behaves similarly to other `findXConfig` methods. PR 11780 ???

## Removed/Deprecated Features

- The data structure `IdGenerator` is deprecated. It could produce duplicate IDs in case of a network split, even with split-brain protection being enabled. Use [Reliable IdGenerator](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#reliable-idgenerator) for an alternative implementation which does not suffer from the mentioned issue.
- The system properties `hazelcast.master.confirmation.interval.seconds` and `hazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds` are deprecated.
