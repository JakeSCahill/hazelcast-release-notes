## Fixes


- ???. [[#???]](???)


## Behavioral Changes

- Edge-case behavior of `findXConfig` methods in the `Config` class changed and methods are more consistent now. The method `findCacheConfig` now behaves similarly to other `findXConfig` methods. PR 11780 ???

## Removed/Deprecated Features

- The data structure `IdGenerator` is deprecated. It could produce duplicate IDs in case of a network split, even with split-brain protection being enabled. Use [Reliable IdGenerator](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10/manual/html-single/index.html#reliable-idgenerator) for an alternative implementation which does not suffer from the mentioned issue.
- The system properties `hazelcast.master.confirmation.interval.seconds` and `hazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds` are deprecated.
