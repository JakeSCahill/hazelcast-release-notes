# 3.6.4

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.4 release.


- `OperationFactoryWrapper` should use `callersUUID` instead of overriding on the member side. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8437" target="_blank">[8437]</a>
- `HazelcastInstanceLoader` ignores "instance-name" for clients. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8413" target="_blank">[8413]</a>
- Usage of `GroupProperties` in Hibernate modules should be removed. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8398" target="_blank">[8398]</a>
- Thread interrupt flag check must be added to `StoreWorker`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8345" target="_blank">[8345]</a>
- Partition proxies are created eventually on all members. However, 
this is an async process driven by the eventing system. If a member does not have a proxy in its registry, then it will not fire `MapPartitionLostListener`. Before firing a partition lost event, proxies should be waited to be created. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8293" target="_blank">[8293]</a>
- Ensure skipping previously removed `CacheEntryListenerConfiguration` entries while iterating over added `CacheEntryListenerConfiguration`s in the `CacheConfig` to register listeners. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8283" target="_blank">[8283]</a>
- Hazelcast instance is started without problems but Management Center does not launch and throws an exception when bundled Jetty is used with Java versions 1.8.0_91 and higher. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8248" target="_blank">[8248]</a>
