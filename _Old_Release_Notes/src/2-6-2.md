# 2.6.2

The following are the fixed issues for 2.6.2 release.

- Client Listener: the `Client` argument has null `Socketaddress` for `ClientDisconnected` listener. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/756" target="_blank">[756]</a>
- Entries put by the method `IMap.putAll` were never evicted from the  map with the TTL configured. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/670" target="_blank">[670]</a>
- The Java client is initialized with two cluster members. After killing one member in the cluster where it is connected, the client is unable to reconnect. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/653" target="_blank">[653]</a>
- Put operation after a missed get operation in a transaction does not have any effect. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/644" target="_blank">[644]</a>
- Near cache functionality does not work for Java client. `MapConfig` always returns the generic map name
since in the client, the client prefix is added to map's name. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/620" target="_blank">[620]</a>
