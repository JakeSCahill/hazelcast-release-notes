The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.5.1 release.

- There is a data inconsistency and loss following the `ClassCastException: CONCURRENT_MAP_REPLACE_IF_SAME`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/462" target="_blank">[462]</a>
- Put operations with zero TTL does not prevent the eviction. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/455" target="_blank">[455]</a>
- `NullPointerException` is thrown at `com.hazelcast.query.MapIndexService.remove` during CONCURRENT_MAP_REMOVE operation. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/454" target="_blank">[454]</a>
- The exception `Failed migrating from Member` is thrown when two clients are started in Eclipse and one is stopped before it is completely initialized. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/452" target="_blank">[452]</a>
- The method `IList.destroy()` does not empty the list. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/449" target="_blank">[449]</a>
- The package `hazelcast-all.jar` should build its manifest dynamically. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/448" target="_blank">[448]</a>
- The package `hazelcast-client.jar` does not deploy as OSGi bundle in JBoss7. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/447" target="_blank">[447]</a>
- The package `hazelcast-wm.jar` should not require `servlet-api` v3.0. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/432" target="_blank">[432]</a>
- `NullPointerException` is thrown when trying to run the method `clear()` on an empty distributed set when migrating from Hazelcast 2.1.2 to 2.4 and 2.5 <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/430" target="_blank">[430]</a>
- The method `getOldValue()` consistently returns wrong results for `entryUpdated` listener notifications after the `replace()` operation. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/418" target="_blank">[418]</a>
- In the Hazelcast configuration schema XSD, the `tcp-ip` and `aws` elements do not have `conn-timeout-seconds` sub-element. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/410" target="_blank">[410]</a>
- It would be nice if the `hazelcast.config` option can be used in combination with the classpath. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/408" target="_blank">[408]</a>
- Deadlock happens when adding an index to a map that is not empty. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/310" target="_blank">[310]</a>
- When custom loader is used with write-behind persistence mode, every time `store()` is called in loader and then `remove()` is called on locked map, value for the key is read from the store and not from map. Consequently, put/set/update is overridden and data is lost. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/187" target="_blank">[187]</a>
