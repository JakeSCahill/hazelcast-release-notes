# 3.6.6

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.6 release.

- `NullPointerException` is thrown while deleting an entry through Entry Processor by setting value to NULL. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/9141" target="_blank">[9141]</a>
- Indefinite reads of stale values from near cache should be prevented. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/9075" target="_blank">[9075]</a>
- Write behind `MapStore` is not retrying to store an entry indefinitely. When an entry cannot be persisted, the retry mechanism stops working after a while. This happens when the distributed map is configured to use the write-behind mechanism. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8918" target="_blank">[8918]</a>
