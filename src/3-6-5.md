# 3.6.5

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.5 release.


- The method `ClusterMergeTask::waitOnFutureInterruptible` has an almost endless loop. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8527" target="_blank">[8527]</a>
- Cluster state should not be allowed to change before startup is completed. Normally, the method `NodeExtension.isStartCompleted()` returns `true` when a member is joined successfully. However, when Hot Restart Store is enabled, it returns `false` until Hot Restart process completes on the whole cluster. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8523" target="_blank">[8523]</a>
- `MapPartitionLostListener` is not working. Upon migration commit, the flag `SYNC_WAITING_REPLICA` should not be overwritten. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8505" target="_blank">[8505]</a>
- Hazelcast Demo application depends on JDK. JRE should be enough on all platforms. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8445" target="_blank">[8445]</a>
- Excessive logging of `is-executing': true` checks against long running operations. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8386" target="_blank">[8386]</a>
- There is a deadlock in `MigrationQueue`. The internal queue and counter are not synced in some situations and this causes deadlock. Usually it happens when there is a migration task failure. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8217" target="_blank">[8217]</a>
- The method `ClientSmartInvocationServiceImpl#invokeOnTarget` does not throw `TargetNotMemberException`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7997" target="_blank">[7997]</a>
- Access data is not updated by local reads when reading from backup is enabled. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7354" target="_blank">[7354]</a>







- Usage of `GroupProperties` in Hibernate modules should be removed. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8398" target="_blank">[8398]</a>
- Thread interrupt flag check must be added to `StoreWorker`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8345" target="_blank">[8345]</a>
- Partition proxies are created eventually on all members. However, 
this is an async process driven by the eventing system. If a member does not have a proxy in its registry, then it will not fire `MapPartitionLostListener`. Before firing a partition lost event, proxies should be waited to be created. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8293" target="_blank">[8293]</a>
- Ensure skipping previously removed `CacheEntryListenerConfiguration` entries while iterating over added `CacheEntryListenerConfiguration`s in the `CacheConfig` to register listeners. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8283" target="_blank">[8283]</a>
- Hazelcast instance is started without problems but Management Center does not launch and throws an exception when bundled Jetty is used with Java versions 1.8.0_91 and higher. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8248" target="_blank">[8248]</a>
