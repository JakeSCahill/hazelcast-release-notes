# 3.8.4

The following are fixed issues and enhancements for Hazelcast 3.8.4 release.


- Added timeout option for the `get` operation when Hazelcast is used within the Spring context. [[#11001]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11001/)
- HTTP HEAD support added to the REST interface. [[#11000]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/11000/)
- `ClientProxy` gets `NullPointerException` from the method `getClient`. [[#10961]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10961)
- Added support for collecting and tracking statistics for all reliable topic proxies on a local member. The statistics are destroyed when the proxy is destroyed. [[#10932]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/10932/)
- The method `containsKey` returns "true" even the key does not exist in the map. [[#10923]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10923)
- Assuming a scenario in which invalidations are generated previously for some other near caches and then later a new near cached map is created, all entries that are near cached before the first reconciliation period will be removed. [[#10913]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10913)
- HTTP upload to Hazelcast fails. The code fails with the exception `BufferOverflowException`. [[#10878]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10878)
- The method `MapProxyImpl.executeOnKeys()` does not work when `ConcurrentSkipListSet` is passed and throws `NullPointerException`. [[#10877]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10877)
