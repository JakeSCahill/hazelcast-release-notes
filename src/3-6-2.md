# 3.6.2

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.2 release.

- Couple of issues related to client should be fixed: (a) There should be no invocations left after client is shut down. (b) When the client-member connection gets an exception from the socket and the method `destroyConnection` is called before the connection is authenticated, the client does not have an endpoint and it is not in the connections map anymore. Connection cannot be closed because of this. (c) Authentication `future` waits infinitely. Because of (b), heartbeat does not work on that connection yet. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/7867" target="_blank">[7867]</a>
- In Hazelcast 3.6.1, the OSGi bundle install fails. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7772" target="_blank">[7772]</a>
- Timeout happens at the `ClientMapBasicTest`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7718" target="_blank">[7718]</a>
- IMap does not send invalidations to the client's near caches after `putAll`/`loadAll` operations at member side. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7715" target="_blank">[7715]</a>
- The test `ClientXAStressTest.testCommitConcurrently` fails due to an assertion error that reads as "the size of the map is not correct". <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7709" target="_blank">[7709]</a>
- The test `ClientTransactionalMapQuorumTest` fails since it timed out. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7693" target="_blank">[7693]</a>
- Wildcards do not work with permissions. For example, when a queue permission is defined using wildcard, i.e. `<queue-permission name="secure.*" principal="admin">` and the queue `secure.orders` is created at the client, Hazelcast throws `AccessControlException`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7616" target="_blank">[7616]</a>
- The FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE eviction policy does not work as documented because the `EvictionChecker` is incorrectly calculating available memory percentage in `checkFreeHeapPercentageEviction`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7599" target="_blank">[7599]</a>
- `DiscoveryStrategy`'s `destroy()` method is not called on shutdown. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7545" target="_blank">[7545]</a>
- The method `MapStore.storeAll()` is never called when the objects are updated with a delay. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7464" target="_blank">[7464]</a>
- WebFilter(3.6-RC1): Session attributes are lost or overwritten with old values when using `deferred-write` by reading them. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7291" target="_blank">[7291]</a>
- The method `HazelcastHttpSession.getAttributeNames()` returns entries that were only read but not written. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7033" target="_blank">[7033]</a>
- Hazelcast 3.5.3 conflicts with FUSE 6.1. When Hazelcast is integrated into a system with JBoss Fuse 6.1, there appeared some warnings in the logs. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6821" target="_blank">[6821]</a>
- An exception is thrown on the server when attempting to deserialize `HIBERNATE4_TYPE_HIBERNATE_CACHE_ENTRY` value. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6683" target="_blank">[6683]</a>
- The test `IOBalancerMemoryLeakTest.testMemoryLeak` fails due to a socket exception that reads as "unexpected end of file from server".  <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6496" target="_blank">[6496]</a>


The following are the enhancements performed for 3.6.2 release.

- Hazelcast Docker images are big in size; it would be better to clean them up and reduce their sizes. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7553" target="_blank">[7553]</a>
- It would be better to provide an `enterprise-javadoc.jar` in the Hazelcast Enterprise bundle. This way IDEs can auto-import the Javadocs for the Enterprise APIs and provide context sensitive completion/help within the IDE. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7245" target="_blank">[7245]</a>
- Management Center WAN Replication metrics take a long time to stabilize. The responsiveness of the Outbound records/sec. metric should be improved. It currently seems to under-report WAN replication performance for 10s of seconds before reaching the same figure as the client side reported metrics.<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7244" target="_blank">[7244]</a>
