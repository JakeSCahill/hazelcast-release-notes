# 3.6.2

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.2 release.

- IMap does not send invalidations to the client's near caches after `putAll`/`loadAll` operations at member side. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7715" target="_blank">[7715]</a>
- Wildcards do not work with permissions. For example, when a queue permission is defined using wildcard, i.e. `<queue-permission name="secure.*" principal="admin">` and the queue `secure.orders` is created at the client, Hazelcast throws `AccessControlException` is created using that name- <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7616" target="_blank">[7616]</a>
- The FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE eviction policy does not work as documented because the `EvictionChecker` is incorrectly calculating available memory percentage in `checkFreeHeapPercentageEviction`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7599" target="_blank">[7599]</a>
- `DiscoveryStrategy`'s `destroy()` method is not called on shutdown. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7545" target="_blank">[7545]</a>
- The method `MapStore.storeAll()` is never called when the objects are updated with a delay. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7464" target="_blank">[7464]</a>

The following are the enhancements performed for 3.6.2 release.

- It would be better to provide an `enterprise-javadoc.jar` in the Hazelcast Enterprise bundle. This way IDEs can auto-import the Javadocs for the Enterprise APIs and provide context sensitive completion/help within the IDE. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7245" target="_blank">[7245]</a>
- Management Center WAN Replication metrics take a long time to stabilize. The responsiveness of the Outbound records/sec. metric should be improved. It currently seems to under-report WAN replication performance for 10s of seconds before reaching the same figure as the client side reported metrics.<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7244" target="_blank">[7244]</a>
