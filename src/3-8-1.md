# 3.8.1

The following are the fixed issues for Hazelcast 3.8.1 release.

- Missing documentation for configuring log4j2 as logging framework. [[#9970]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9970)
- Multicast configuration's `trusted-interfaces` element is not handled properly on startup of the members. [[#9953]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9953)
- For Hazelcast 3.7.*, MigrationListener's `migrationStarted` and `migrationCompleted` methods are called for all partitions. [[#9919]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9919)
- Behavior of aggregators when extracted value is null should be well-documented. [[#9858]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9858)
- Hazelcast Java client disconnects from the cluster with heartbeat problems. [[#8956]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8956)
- Client's near cache implementation uses `userExecutor` which is also used for other purposes such as making callbacks to lifecycle listeners. A client may block an operation of the near cache updates by a slow lifecycle listener. This needs to be addressed. [[#8651]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8651)


The following are the enhancements performed for Hazelcast 3.8.1 release.
