# 3.6.7

The following is the fixed issue for 3.6.7 release.

- When loading keys supplied by the user, `keyLoaderState` should not be changed. In some cases, `MapLoader.loadAll(true)` does not reload after reloading with new keys. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/9279" target="_blank">[9279]</a>
