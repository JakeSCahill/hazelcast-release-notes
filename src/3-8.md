- **???:** ???. Please refer to the [???](???) pages.

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- Client tasks should be bounced back when a member has not completely start yet. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8715" target="_blank">[8715]</a>
- Currently the property `com.hazelcast.map.impl.eviction.ExpirationManager.PERIOD` is hard-coded to 5 seconds. Making it a configurable property will help in tuning the eviction. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8277" target="_blank">[8277]</a>
- The method `com.hazelcast.topic.impl.TopicProxy#publish` serializes the message even if the message is never sent due to having no subscribers. In the case of non-global-ordering and non-client use, the implementation should defer serialization until it has established that there are subscribers. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8262" target="_blank">[8262]</a>
- Currently if you want to use Container-Managed Transactions with Hazelcast within a JEE Application Server, you need to use the provided JCA Adapter. This JCA Adapter creates a Hazelcast instance. This should be allowed: configuration of the JCA Adapter to be either Server or Client-based. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5667" target="_blank">[5667]</a>
