- **Improvement in WAN Queue Full Behavior**: Now, Hazelcast throws an exception when the queue is full and replication is active, unless it is stopped on the Management Center. Please note that this enhancement is available for Hazelcast Enterprise. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8/manual/html-single/index.html#queue-full-behavior" target="_blank">Queue Full Behavior section</a>.

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.


- Client support for distributed scheduled executor service. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9385" target="_blank">[9385]</a>
- When a member without JCache service joins a cluster where JCache service is enabled but not used, the member should not fail. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9301" target="_blank">[9301]</a>
- It would be nice to have names assigned to all threads created by Hazelcast (and not the default ones, e.g., `pool-2-thread-1`, `pool-2-thread-2`). <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9210" target="_blank">[9210]</a>
- There should be a more detailed and clarifying information in the diagnostics of `PartitionIteratingOperation`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8855" target="_blank">[8855]</a>
- When there is no access to `NodeEngine`, the logger should be able to be used from a static context without any side effects to the logging configuration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8760" target="_blank">[8760]</a>
- Client tasks should be bounced back when a member has not completely start yet. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8715" target="_blank">[8715]</a>
- A method `size(Predicate)` should be added to determine the size of predicate results. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8555" target="_blank">[8555]</a>
- Currently the property `com.hazelcast.map.impl.eviction.ExpirationManager.PERIOD` is hard-coded to 5 seconds. Making it a configurable property will help in tuning the eviction. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8277" target="_blank">[8277]</a>
- The method `com.hazelcast.topic.impl.TopicProxy#publish` serializes the message even if the message is never sent due to having no subscribers. In the case of non-global-ordering and non-client use, the implementation should defer serialization until it has established that there are subscribers. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8262" target="_blank">[8262]</a>
- Hazelcast should provide an abstract Mapper implementation which invokes the Supplier given to `Aggregation#getMapper()`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7477" target="_blank">[7477]</a>
- Configuration setting for WAN replication queue should be only for primary entries. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7124" target="_blank">[7124]</a>
- Currently if you want to use Container-Managed Transactions with Hazelcast within a JEE Application Server, you need to use the provided JCA Adapter. This JCA Adapter creates a Hazelcast instance. This should be allowed: configuration of the JCA Adapter to be either Server or Client-based. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5667" target="_blank">[5667]</a>
- Currently `PartitionIteratingOperation` consumes a generic operation thread, while the operations for the partitions are running. This means that the generic thread pool can dry out and this can cause a lot of problems for important tasks that cannot be executed since the thread pool is empty. A `PartitionIteratingService` should be introduced where the system can lookup TraceableOperations. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4889" target="_blank">[4889]</a>
- Hazelcast Shutdown Hook calls the method `terminate()` instead of `shutdown()`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4648" target="_blank">[4648]</a>
- Hazelcast should support `ScheduledExecutorService`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/115" target="_blank">[115]</a>




## Fixes

The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.8 release.

- Replicated Map configured with `async-fillup` as `false` prevents further members from joining the cluster. Members are stuck in an endless loop. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9592" target="_blank">[9592]</a>
- When an exception is thrown from an `InitializingObject`'s initialize method, it is logged in WARNING level but then swallowed and the proxy object is added to the `ProxyRegistry`. Instead, the exception should result in removing the object from the `ProxyRegistry`, as it is already done for exceptions thrown from `service.createDistributedObject`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9578" target="_blank">[9578]</a>
- JCache client needs access to `CacheLoader` implementation to work. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9453" target="_blank">[9453]</a>
- The matching wildcard is strict, but no declaration can be found for element `hz:hazelcast`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9406" target="_blank">[9406]</a>
- "Connection Reset" warning shows up in the class `CloudyUtility`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9404" target="_blank">[9404]</a>
- The method `getAll` is not updating the `localMapStats`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9373" target="_blank">[9373]</a>
- Hazelcast 3.7.3 and Spring Boot 1.4.2 get the error `PortableFactory[-22] is already registered`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9353" target="_blank">[9353]</a>
- There is an issue when integrating with WebLogic 12c. Classloading logging should be added when `DefaultNodeExtension` is loaded by multiple classloaders. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9291" target="_blank">[9291]</a>
- The method `MapLoader.loadAll(true)` does not reload after reloading with new keys. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9255" target="_blank">[9255]</a>
- Problems with timeout in blocking calls. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9250" target="_blank">[9250]</a>
- Stale reads from Map inside a transaction should be guaranteed, when Near Cache and delayed MapStore are enabled. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9248" target="_blank">[9248]</a>
- Client protocol cannot handle "null"s in the collection. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9240" target="_blank">[9240]</a>
- `LifecycleState` events are not received when Hazelcast docker image is used. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9189" target="_blank">[9189]</a>
- If there is no network, multicast socket exception is thrown. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9081" target="_blank">[9081]</a>
- Hazelcast is not handling XML configuration attribute for `DurableExecutorService`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9078" target="_blank">[9078]</a>
- When retrieving data from Java Hazelcast instance, `HazelcastSerializationException` is thrown from the .NET client. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8985" target="_blank">[8985]</a>
- Callback for time to live (for map eviction) is invoked with a significant delay. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8894" target="_blank">[8894]</a>
- "Warning 2" in `IMap::tryRemove` method's code comments is not correct. This method returns only a boolean. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8884" target="_blank">[8884]</a>
- When clients lose connection to the members in the cluster, even after the clients are reconnected to the cluster, the Entry/Message Listeners are never fired again. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8847" target="_blank">[8847]</a>
- Nested queries on `VersionedPortables` with different versions cannot be performed. Hazelcast throws IllegalArgumentException. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8846" target="_blank">[8846]</a>
- Fixed `max-size` value behavior for Near Cache configuration. If you set 0 for the `max-size`, now, it is valued as `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as expected and documented. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8826" target="_blank">[8826]</a>
- While generating the XML string from a configuration object in `ConfigXmlGenerator.generate()` method, `native-memory` configuration is not appended to the result string. This causes the `native-memory` configuration for members not to be shown on the Management Center. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8825" target="_blank">[8825]</a>
- "Client heartbeat is timed out , closing connection" warning shows up indefinitely on AWS. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8777" target="_blank">[8777]</a>
- Spring XML configuration: The smart routing attribute defaults to false while the documentation says it defaults to true. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8746" target="_blank">[8746]</a>
- Distributed objects present in the cluster do not show the same values. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8743" target="_blank">[8743]</a>
- In Hazelcast 3.6.3, the error `Current thread is not owner of the lock` shows up when using Hazelcast client to perform the actions. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8730" target="_blank">[8730]</a>
- Bulk `get` operation with 100 keys fails. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8535" target="_blank">[8535]</a>
- An `IllegalThreadStateException` may be thrown sometimes on a member of a cluster with two or more members when a Hazelcast client creates a new map with configured indexes. This exception is not thrown when indexes are created programmatically. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8492" target="_blank">[8492]</a>
- Group and password attributes in Hibernate integration module should be validated. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7978" target="_blank">[7978]</a>
- There appears to be an inconsistency where JCache uses the `EvictionConfig` object, but IMap directly uses properties of the `NearCacheConfig`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7788" target="_blank">[7788]</a>
- Topic listeners are lost after merging from a split-brain scenario. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7742" target="_blank">[7742]</a>
- Member attributes go missing after merging from a split-brain scenario. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7697" target="_blank">[7697]</a>
- There should be a distributed class loading feature to perform distributed loading of classes so that jobs like MapReduce and Aggregate can be done more effectively. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7394" target="_blank">[7394]</a>
- MapLoader misses state updates on second load on the receiver members. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7364" target="_blank">[7364]</a>
- If the system retries an operation because a member is leaving the cluster, the invocation can be retried due to the response but also due to the "member-left" event. In most cases this should not lead to a problem, but the invocation may be executed twice. This can be a problem and can lead to a permanent inconsistent system. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7270" target="_blank">[7270]</a>
- Using Lock and Map, the heap memory on Hazelcast server keeps increasing. All the created Locks and Maps are destroyed by the method `destroy()`, but the memory cannot be destroyed by the garbage collector even via FGC. When an application runs for some time, Hazelcast server goes down. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7246" target="_blank">[7246]</a>
- Hazelcast 3.5 throws `InvalidConfigurationException`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6523" target="_blank">[6523]</a>
- More granular mutexes should be used when creating and removing a set of closeable cache resources. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6273" target="_blank">[6273]</a>
- Running `PredicateBuilder` queries when nodes join causes timeouts and cluster crash. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6242" target="_blank">[6242]</a>
- The method `setEvictionPolicy` for near cache configuration wants a string argument whereas the same for map configuration wants an enum value. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2010" target="_blank">[2010]</a>


## Removed/Deprecated Features

- Aggregators feature is deprecated. Instead, Fast-Aggregations feature should be used.
