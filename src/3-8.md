## Enhancements


The following are the the enhancements introduced with 3.8 release.

- **???:** ???. Please refer to the [???](???) pages.

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- There should be a more detailed and clarifying information in the diagnostics of `PartitionIteratingOperation`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8855" target="_blank">[8855]</a>
- When there is no access to `NodeEngine`, the logger should be able to be used from a static context without any side effects to the logging configuration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8760" target="_blank">[8760]</a>
- Client tasks should be bounced back when a member has not completely start yet. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8715" target="_blank">[8715]</a>
- Currently the property `com.hazelcast.map.impl.eviction.ExpirationManager.PERIOD` is hard-coded to 5 seconds. Making it a configurable property will help in tuning the eviction. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8277" target="_blank">[8277]</a>
- The method `com.hazelcast.topic.impl.TopicProxy#publish` serializes the message even if the message is never sent due to having no subscribers. In the case of non-global-ordering and non-client use, the implementation should defer serialization until it has established that there are subscribers. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8262" target="_blank">[8262]</a>
- Currently if you want to use Container-Managed Transactions with Hazelcast within a JEE Application Server, you need to use the provided JCA Adapter. This JCA Adapter creates a Hazelcast instance. This should be allowed: configuration of the JCA Adapter to be either Server or Client-based. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5667" target="_blank">[5667]</a>
- Currently `PartitionIteratingOperation` consumes a generic operation thread, while the operations for the partitions are running. This means that the generic thread pool can dry out and this can cause a lot of problems for important tasks that cannot be executed since the thread pool is empty. A `PartitionIteratingService` should be introduced where the system can lookup TraceableOperations. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4889" target="_blank">[4889]</a>



## Fixes

The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.8 release.

- Client protocol cannot handle "null"s in the collection. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9240" target="_blank">[9240]</a>
- Callback for time to live (for map eviction) is invoked with a significant delay. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8894" target="_blank">[8894]</a>
- "Warning 2" in `IMap::tryRemove` method's code comments is not correct. This method returns only a boolean. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8884" target="_blank">[8884]</a>
- When clients lose connection to the members in the cluster, even after the clients are reconnected to the cluster, the Entry/Message Listeners are never fired again. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8847" target="_blank">[8847]</a>
- Spring XML configuration: The smart routing attribute defaults to false while the documentation says it defaults to true. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8746" target="_blank">[8746]</a>
- In Hazelcast 3.6.3, the error `Current thread is not owner of the lock` shows up when using Hazelcast client to perform the actions. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8730" target="_blank">[8730]</a>
- Member attributes go missing after merging from a split-brain scenario. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7697" target="_blank">[7697]</a>
- The method `setEvictionPolicy` for near cache configuration wants a string argument whereas the same for map configuration wants an enum value. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2010" target="_blank">[2010]</a>
