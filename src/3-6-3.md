# 3.6.3

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.3 release.

- When using `InstanceOfPredicate`, the method `toObject` at the server side causes `NullPointerException`, since the classloader is not set and it is null. Default classloader should be used if it is not set by the configuration to avoid the exception. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/7977" target="_blank">[7977]</a>
- There may be cases when the server may return a list of entries larger than the requested page size. In this case the client should not put any anchor into the list that is on a page greater than the requested page. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/7976" target="_blank">[7976]</a>
- When a remote invocation waits indefinitely on the internal executor, a deadlock may occur since its response would use the same executor and since the invocation monitor runs on the same executor. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/7944" target="_blank">[7944]</a>
- Already published messages should be retrieved after `StaleSequenceException` occurs when `ReliableMessageListener` is registered at the client side. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/7928" target="_blank">[7928]</a>

The following are the enhancements performed for 3.6.3 release.

- Phone home should include environment information, such as the operating system name, version and kernel architecture. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/7970" target="_blank">[7970]</a>
- Exceptions, which are thrown when the method `isMemberSafe()` is called, should go into finest level. When there are topology changes some exceptions are expected. The method `getFutureResult()` should log exceptions as `finest()`, not `warn()`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/7904" target="_blank">[7904]</a>
