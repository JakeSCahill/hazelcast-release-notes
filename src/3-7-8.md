# 3.7.8

The following is the fixed issue for 3.7.8 release.

- When the cluster state is `PASSIVE`, the background expiration task can get an exception (in `ClearExpiredOperation`) during execution. But after the cluster state transitions to `ACTIVE`, it should continue to process. The task's progress conditions should be reset in case of any execution exception.. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/10636" target="_blank">[10636]</a>
