== 3.10.4


=== Enhancements

* License information was not sent to Hazelcast Management Center. With this enhancement, Hazelcast Management Center shows information about the cluster license. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13451[[#13451]]

=== Fixes

* Fixed inconsistencies in `mapEventJournal` calls coming from `DefaultRecordStore`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13470[[#13470]]
* Fixed index data loss after rolling upgrade: when a rolling update of an application is performed; first instance is turned off, updated and after it is done, the second instance takes place. After such a rolling update (without the downtime) some of the data was lost. It turned out that after the Split-Brain merge process, the index gets corrupted. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13456[[#13456]]
* Changed repartitioning mechanism so that it is trigged only when needed during the change of cluster state. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13446[[#13446]]
* Made attribute extractor to use User Code Deployment for searching extractor implementation. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13400[[#13400]]
