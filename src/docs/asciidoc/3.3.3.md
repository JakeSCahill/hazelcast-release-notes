The following are the fixed issues for 3.3.3 release.


- JCache average put time statistic is not calculated correctly [[#4029]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4029).
- When sending backup, the replica address can be seen as null [[#4001]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4001).
- Evicted events are sent before the added events to EntryListeners [[#3992]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3992).
- In Management Center, the default login credentials cannot be deleted [[#3990]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3990).
- Logger for `NodeMulticastListener` does not belong to `com.hazelcast` hierarchy [[#3941]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3941).
- MapInterceptors are not removed when a node leaves the cluster [[#3932]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3932).
- MapInterceptors of same type (`Class`) are chained [[#3931]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3931).
- Expiration Time should not be updated. Its value is updated on every set operation on a map, but Hazelcast uses only the first value set for ExpirationTime. So a `getExpirationTime()` operation returns a wrong and misleading value. [[#3923]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3923).
- When using the XML file to configure a Queue to use a `QueueStoreFactory`, a null pointer exception is thrown at `QueueStoreWrapper` [[#3907]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3907).
- Excess logging on startup [[#3869]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3869).
- `LifecycleService` should be terminated after the node cannot join to the cluster [[#3843]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3843).
- The method `MapProxyImpl.aggregate` hangs sporadically [[#3824]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3824).
- Currently, there is no class named `com.hazelcast.nio.utf8.EnterpriseStringCreator` in Hazelcast. So the class and its log messages should be removed from the code [[#3819]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3819).
- Bad user interface experience in the management center. Maps menu item that contains maps with longer names cannot be expanded [[#3815]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3815).
- When the shutdown button in the management center is hit multiple times, the nodes are shutdown again, after they are shutdown at the first place and restarted [[#3718]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3718).
- Alert e-mails from the management center are not sent to the e-mail address [[#3693]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3693).
- Instances with private IPs cannot be discovered on Amazon EC2 [[#3666]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3666).
- Null pointer exception in the method `Records.buildRecordInfo` from the stabilizer `MapStoreTest` [[#2956]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2956).
