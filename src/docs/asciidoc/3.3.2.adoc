* Reject multicast messages if the group configuration is not matching
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3806[[#3806]].

during multicast join
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3732[[#3732]].

EntryProcessors. A delay should be added to expiration times on backups

* `containsKey()` in transactional context returns wrong value for keys
deleted within transaction
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3682[[#3682]].

within the transaction boundary
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3668[[#3668]].
* Number of loaded keys should not exceed mapâ€™s maximum size
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3608[[#3608]].
