The following are the fixed issues for 3.3.2 release.


- Reject multicast messages if the group configuration is not matching [[#3806]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3806).
- `Map#getEntryView` should check expiration of a key [[#3801]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3801).
- Hazelcast gets stuck in `HazelcastInstanceNotActiveException` loop during multicast join [[#3732]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3732).
- Hazelcast fails to comply with `maxIdleTime` expiration when running EntryProcessors. A delay should be added to expiration times on backups [[#3710]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3710).
- `containsKey()` in transactional context returns wrong value for keys deleted within transaction [[#3682]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3682).
- `TransactionalMap.values()` returns stale values that was updated within the transaction boundary [[#3668]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3668).
- Number of loaded keys should not exceed map's maximum size [[#3608]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3608).
- During client node shutdown, if the cluster happens to be down, Hazelcast logs some extra messages at SEVERE level [[#3493]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3493).
