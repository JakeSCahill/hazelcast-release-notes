== 3.7.2

The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.2 release.

* The container `WaitingOperation` (which wraps `BlockingOperation`) is
asked for call ID/caller address. But this container object does not
have any sensible information, so the heartbeat is not constructed
correctly for a blocked operation. [8979]
* JCache backup operation does not propagate the exception
`CacheNotExists`. [8955]
* The log message ``unsafe unavailable'' is at WARNING level and it also
displays the full stack trace. [8852]
* When a predicate for distributed query is executed on a lite member it
throws the exception `ClassNotFound`. [8849]
* While running under non-HotSpot JVM, the exception `NoSuchField` is
thrown. [8835]
