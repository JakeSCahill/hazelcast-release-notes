The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.2 release.

- The container `WaitingOperation` (which wraps `BlockingOperation`) is
asked for call ID/caller address. But this container object does not have any sensible
information, so the heartbeat is not constructed correctly for a blocked operation. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8955" target="_blank">[8979]</a>
- JCache backup operation does not propagate the exception `CacheNotExists`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8955" target="_blank">[8955]</a>
- The log message "unsafe unavailable" is at WARNING level and it also displays the full stack trace. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8852" target="_blank">[8852]</a>
- When a predicate for distributed query is executed on a lite member it throws the exception `ClassNotFound`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8849" target="_blank">[8849]</a>
- While running under non-HotSpot JVM, the exception `NoSuchField` is thrown. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8835" target="_blank">[8835]</a>
