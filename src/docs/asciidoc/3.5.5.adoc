The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.5.5 release.

- When `hazelcast.jmx` option is enabled, MBeans are created for every Hazelcast object but they are never removed. When destroying Hazelcast object with the method `destroy()`, `DistributedObjectEvent::getDistributedObject()` throws `DistributedObjectDestroyedException` and stops the process of unregistering MBeans. MBeans are left forever causing memory leaks and they can be seen in VisualVM.  [[#7329]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7329)
- `IdGenerator` sometimes generates duplicate IDs if it is put under stress. [[#7299]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7299)
- The method `IAtomicLong.compareAndSet()` does not properly backup its updated state. In a two node cluster, if you use this method and then shutdown the owner of the `IAtomicLong`, the remaining node no longer sees the updated value. [[#7290]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7290)
- `InvocationMonitor` checks for the same invocations continuously. [[#7170]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7170)
- The methods `IMap.getAsync` and `IMap.putAsync` should update the statistics `getCount` and `putCount`, etc. [[#7109]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7109)
- `NullPointerException` is thrown for `CoalescedWriteBehindQueue.removeFirstOccurrence()`. [[#7082]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7082)
- The quorum definition in the Spring context is not correct. [[#6946]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6946)
- While publishing events, IMap operations convert the value to data even if the registered listener does not request the value. [[#6866]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6866)
- Map entry event listeners are not invoked on the clients of WAN replication target cluster. [[#6802]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6802)
- The method `putAsync` does not affect `LocalMapStats.getPutOperationCount()`. [[#6731]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6731)
- Possible memory leak when using `IMap.containsKey`. Problem happens when `containsKey` is used for a value that exists in the `MapStore`. Entry is loaded from the store but it does not get added to the map (no event is triggered in this case), eventually the system crashes with no memory. [[#6517]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6517)
- Performance test with Spring Batch throws `TargetDisconnectedException`. [[#4230]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4230)
- Web session replication does not work as expected during a shutdown. [[#3362]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3362)
- The parameter `session-ttl-seconds` is set after the instance creation. It should be set before the instance is created. [[#2377]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2377)
