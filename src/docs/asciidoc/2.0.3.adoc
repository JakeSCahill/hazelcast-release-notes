== 2.0.3

The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.0.3 release.

* Increasing amount of stuck Hazelcast threads in weblogic; in a
clustered environment and also when running a single instance. [160]
* Hyphens in the group names confuse the Management Center. It treats
the group name as two separate tokens. [128]
* Split-brain merge handling causes the locks never to be acquired
again. [127]
* `ConfigXmlGenerator` does not handle the TTL correctly when multicast
joining mechanism is used. [127]
* Data is lost in a map when adding a key the second time after a new
member joins the cluster. [117]
* Listeners are not called when a queue is changed within a transaction.
[114]
* Programmatic session destruction does not lead to the destruction of
the clustered session. [104]
* The name for `hazelcast.sessionId` should be configurable. [103]
* There is an issue in concurrent `queue.take()` and
`txn.rollback()`.[99]
