== 2.6.2

The following are the fixed issues for 2.6.2 release.

* Client Listener: the `Client` argument has null `Socketaddress` for
`ClientDisconnected` listener. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/756[#756]
* Entries put by the method `IMap.putAll` were never evicted from the
map with the TTL configured. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/670[#670]
* The Java client is initialized with two cluster members. After killing
one member in the cluster where it is connected, the client is unable to
reconnect. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/653[#653]
* Put operation after a missed get operation in a transaction does not
have any effect. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/644[#644]
* Near cache functionality does not work for Java client. `MapConfig`
always returns the generic map name since in the client, the client
prefix is added to mapâ€™s name. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/620[#620]
