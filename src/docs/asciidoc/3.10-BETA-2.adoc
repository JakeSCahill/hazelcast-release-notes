## Enhancements

- Added ID count to flake ID generators statistics. [[#12612]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12612)
- It is still required to provide a group and password while configuring with Spring: the attribute `required` should be removed from the tag `group` both for name and password elements. [[#12462]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12462)

## Fixes

- `ReplicatedMapConfig` must not be mutated while constructing read-only variant. [[#12620]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12620)
- Exception in Node constructor doesn't shutdown services properly. [[#12587]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12587)
- `CacheNotExistsException` must be thrown when cache configuration does not exist. [[#12593]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12593)
- Index configurations must be respected in query caches. [[#12577]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12577)
- Issues with replicated map and lite members: (i) replicated map cannot be used after lite member promotion, (ii) replicated map runs into `NPE` after a split-brain healing. [[#12537]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12537)
- Eviction causes absence of an entry in IMap and MapStore at the same time: just after the method `evictAll` is invoked, the map is cleared and the eviction is done in a different thread. This causes the objects not being available both IMap and MapStore. [[#12455]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12455)
- JCache 1.1 TCK: the test `org.jsr107.tck.event.CacheListenerTest` passes, but there are assertion errors in the log. [[#12390]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12390)
- An index aware predicate does not invoke its `apply` method:  only the index operation is performed and the apply filter is silently ignored. [[#12352]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12352)
- Query with predicates on IMap does not use index when running locally. [[#12351]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12351)
- `EventJournal` loses data if two members terminate: Scenario is starting a cluster with four members and a client, producing data for the event journal, terminating one member and terminating another member after some time. When checking the total count of events, it is seen that some data is lost. [[#12300]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12300)
- When minority of members are removed from the network, read/write failures occur on the cluster. [[#12240]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12240)
- A merge policy cannot be defined for replicated maps using declarative configuration (XML). [[#12223]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12223)
- All dynamic configurations are sent out in a prejoin operation regardless of the cluster version. [[#12151]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12151)
- When using `PagingPredicate`, setting a too big page ends up with `IllegalArgumentException`. [[#12079]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12079)
- There is a performance regression on predicate queries for 3.9.1 and 3.8.7 versions. [[#12018]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12018)
- Each new configuration method introduced in 3.10 must be overridden in the client-side dynamic configuration support class. [[#12010]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12010)
- For some of the scheduled jobs, the method `getLastRunDuration()` returns negative values for quick executions. [[#11929]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11929)
- Exception in `ResponseThreadRunnable` causes the REST API to fail: When there is an exception while processing a single command, the entire thread is killed. It causes an unrecoverable condition when the system does not process any incoming REST commands, and hence the memory leak (incoming commands are accumulated in blockingQueue). [[#11722]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11722)
- Accessing a query cache with a reasonable amount of data can result in an `NPE`. [[#11675]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11675)
- `IMap.add` and `IMap.remove`: EntryListener randomly hangs. [[#11470]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11470)
- Members not rejoining cluster after an elongated network disconnectivity: Assuming that, initially there is a cluster of 8 members and when the connectivity for a member is broken it gets eliminated from the cluster. The original cluster contains now 7 members and this is working as expected. However, when the connectivity is restored, the disconnected member is not able to join the original cluster and remains isolated. [[#11267]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11267)
- There is a minor decrease in the performance of indexed searches for 3.7.6 and higher versions. [[#11231]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11231)
- The code comments for time-to-live expiration is not clear. [[#11787]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11787)
- When setting the same key value twice, `NPE` is thrown on the member. [[#10556]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10556)
- JCache fails to initialize when the type of a key or value is not available on a remote member. [[#8972]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8972)
- In Hazelcast 3.7, `PollOperation` invocation is failing to complete due to `operation-heartbeat-timeout`. [[#8831]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8831)
- Custom `LoggerFactory` is instantiating two times. [[#5641]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5641)
