== 2.3.1

The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.3.1 release.

* Changed `hazelcast.partition.migration.interval` propertyâ€™s value from
1 to 0.
* The method `ILock.newCondition()` now throws
`UnsupportedOperationException`.
* After upgrading Hazelcast to 2.3, IPv6 is no longer supported in TCP
join mechanism. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/258[#258]
* `ClassCastException` is thrown when the method `MultiMap.get()` is
run. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/256[#256]
* Currently, the method `MultiMap.get(K key)` returns null if there are
no values associated with the key. However, it should return an empty
collection instead. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/167[#167]
