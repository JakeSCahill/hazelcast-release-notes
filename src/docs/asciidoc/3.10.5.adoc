== 3.10.5

=== Enhancements

* Introduced OperationThreadSamples as a new diagnostics plugin. It samples the operation threads and checks the running operations/tasks. See http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.10.5/manual/html-single/#operationthreadsamples[OperationThreadSamples].

=== Fixes


* Added a workaround for the `Constructor` cache, which performs caching under incorrect keys, such that you have now the option not to use that cache. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13679[[#13679]]
* A client connection could not detect whether it has been idle and hence the member closes the connection. This is fixed now so that the member does not close the connections when the clients only listen. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13576[[#13576]]
* Fixed the `MultiMapValue` serialization error occurred when merging MultiMap entries. It was caused by firing MERGE events which expect the entry values to be serialized. Since MultiMap does not have a MERGE listener, there was no need to fire these events; this has been fixed and now no MERGE events are fired during the merging process. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13559[[#13559]]
* When a client is waiting for a lock to be released for a period more than invocation timeout seconds and the member dies, the client was getting an operation timeout exception. This behavior is fixed so that the operation is now retried on the new member of that lock. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13551[[#13551]]
* By default Hazelcast map evicts just a single entry in each eviction cycle. This was insufficient when inserting entries with increasingly larger payload size - as evicting a single entry cannot make sufficient room for a new (larger) entry. This is fixed by introducing a configurable batch size for map eviction. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13529[[#13529]]
* Fixed the incorrect unit declaration in `EntryView` class' Javadoc: the method `getTtl()` returns a value in milliseconds, it was declared that it is in seconds.  https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13523[[#13523]]
* When a client is disconnected, the member was cleaning up resources but not the pending invocations. This is fixed so that the member now cleans up the pending invocations.  https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13388[[#13388]]
