== 3.6.2

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.2 release.

* Upon subsequent destroy and creation of IMap, there is a possibility
that there can be more than one map-containers referenced by different
record-stores at the same time. Hence, indexes can be created in an
unexpected map-container and this can lead to return less than expected
number of results when IMap is queried. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7874[#7874]
* Couple of issues related to client should be fixed: (a) There should
be no invocations left after client is shut down. (b) When the
client-member connection gets an exception from the socket and the
method `destroyConnection` is called before the connection is
authenticated, the client does not have an endpoint and it is not in the
connections map anymore. Connection cannot be closed because of this.
(c) Authentication `future` waits infinitely. Because of (b), heartbeat
does not work on that connection yet. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7867[#7867]
* In Hazelcast 3.6.1, the OSGi bundle install fails. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7772[#7772]
* Timeout happens at the `ClientMapBasicTest`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7718[#7718]
* IMap does not send invalidations to the client’s near caches after
`putAll`/`loadAll` operations at member side. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7715[#7715]
* The test `ClientXAStressTest.testCommitConcurrently` fails due to an
assertion error that reads as `the size of the map is not correct`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7709[#7709]
* The test `ClientTransactionalMapQuorumTest` fails since it timed out.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7693[#7693]
* Wildcards do not work with permissions. For example, when a queue
permission is defined using wildcard, i.e.,
`<queue-permission name="secure.*" principal="admin">` and the queue
`secure.orders` is created at the client, Hazelcast throws
`AccessControlException`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7616[#7616]
* The FREE_HEAP_PERCENTAGE eviction policy does not work as documented
because the `EvictionChecker` is incorrectly calculating available
memory percentage in `checkFreeHeapPercentageEviction`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7599[#7599]
* `DiscoveryStrategy`’s `destroy()` method is not called on shutdown.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7545[#7545]
* The method `MapStore.storeAll()` is never called when the objects are
updated with a delay. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7464[#7464]
* WebFilter(3.6-RC1): Session attributes are lost or overwritten with
old values when using `deferred-write` by reading them. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7291[#7291]
* The method `HazelcastHttpSession.getAttributeNames()` returns entries
that were only read but not written. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7033[#7033]
* Hazelcast 3.5.3 conflicts with FUSE 6.1. When Hazelcast is integrated
into a system with JBoss Fuse 6.1, there appeared some warnings in the
logs. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6821[#6821]
* An exception is thrown on the server when attempting to deserialize
`HIBERNATE4_TYPE_HIBERNATE_CACHE_ENTRY` value. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6683[#6683]
* The test `IOBalancerMemoryLeakTest.testMemoryLeak` fails due to a
socket exception that reads as `unexpected end of file from server`.

The following are the enhancements performed for 3.6.2 release.

* Hazelcast Docker images are big in size; it would be better to clean
them up and reduce their sizes. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7553[#7553]
* It would be better to provide an `enterprise-javadoc.jar` in the
Hazelcast Enterprise bundle. This way IDEs can auto-import the Javadocs
for the Enterprise APIs and provide context sensitive completion/help
within the IDE. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7245[#7245]
* Management Center WAN Replication metrics take a long time to
stabilize. The responsiveness of the Outbound records/sec. metric should
be improved. It currently seems to under-report WAN replication
performance for 10s of seconds before reaching the same figure as the
client side reported metrics.https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7244[#7244]
