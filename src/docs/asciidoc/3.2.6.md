-	MapStore in write-behind mode throws Exception (Spring configured) [[#3397]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3397).

-	Map eviction does not work when the policy is "USED_HEAP_PERCENTAGE" or "USED_HESAP SIZE" [[#3321]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3321).
-	Exceptions when using Portable serialization [[#3313]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3313).

-	Null Pointer Exception is thrown by `MapService.dispatchEvent` [[#3101]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3101).
-	PagingPredicate returns duplicated elements which result in an infinite loop [[#3047]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3047).
-	`ContextClassLoader` is by default only set on some cached operation threads, not on most others [[#2721]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2721).
