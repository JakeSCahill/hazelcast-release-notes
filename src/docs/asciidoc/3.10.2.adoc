[[fixes-3102]]
=== Fixes

* If the inner predicate of the paging predicate returns an empty result set, the paging predicate returns null as the indexed query result: this is interpreted as an absence of the indexed result by the query engine and the execution falls back to the full scan. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13159[#13159]
* While doing a rolling upgrade with a mixed 3.9 - 3.10 cluster running on 3.9 cluster version, cache configurations must be converted to `CacheConfig` before dispatched to 3.9 members. Otherwise, a `PreJoinCacheConfig` could be stored on a 3.9 member's cache configurations registry (`AbstractCacheService.configs`) and from there it may leak to a client getting the cache configuration causing deserialization errors on the client side. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13137[#13137]
* `NullPointerException` is thrown when accessing endpoints on the message task using `AbstractMessageTask.getClientVersion`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13119[#13119]
* `NullPointerException` is thrown during the authentication, if the connection is closed right before `bind`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13118[#13118]
