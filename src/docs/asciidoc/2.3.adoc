== 2.3

This section lists the new features, enhancements and fixed issues for
2.3 release.

=== New Features and Changes

The following are the new features and changes introduced with 2.3
release.

* Changed `hazelcast.max.operation.timeout` unit from seconds to
milliseconds.
* Added `hazelcast.max.concurrent.operation.limit` property to be able
to limit the number of concurrent operations that can be submitted to
Hazelcast.
* Added `hazelcast.backup.redo.enabled` property to enable/disable redo
for backup operations.
* Added MultiMap and Distributed ExecutorService statistics to
Management Center application.
* `MigrationListener` has now an additional method to receive failed
migration events; `void migrationFailed(MigrationEvent migrationEvent)`.
* `ItemEvent` has now an additional method returning Member firing that
event; `public Member getMember()`.
* Improved out of memory (OOM) error detection and handling. Now it is
possible to register a custom hook when OutOfMemoryError is thrown.
* Fixed some issues related to domain name handling and networking/join.
* During cluster merge after a network split-brain, merging side will
now fire MERGING and MERGED before and after RESTARTING and RESTARTED
LifecycleEvents.

=== Fixes

The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.3 release.

* Operation exceptions occur randomly while the SQL predicates are
stress tested. [263]
* `EOF` exception is thrown in Management Center. [252]
* The method `IMap.flush()` delegates map store exceptions to the caller
instead of suppressing them. [250]
* Node appears to be in multiple clusters. [247]
* It would be nice to have Spring support in Runnable tasks. [244]
* MERGING and MERGED events should be fired during a split-brain merging
process. [241]
* A problem occurs during a quick restart of master node. [235]
* Distributed `tryLock()` throws `NullPointerException` from lite
member. [233]
* Using domain instead of IP address is problematic. [230]
* The method `MultiMap.lock()` blocks forever. [228]
* `SimpleMapTest` uses deprecated method `Hazelcast.getLoggingService()`
and annoys WebLogic 12. [227]
* `ItemEvent` should have a `getMember` method to return the member that
offered/polled an item. [226]
* The consumers do `queue.take()` and block until something is put on
the queue. In Hazelcast 2.1.2, this was fine, but in 2.2, it causes a
massive amount of WARN-level log spam. [225]
* The method `MultiMap.put()` is inconsistent when the key is locked by
another node/thread. [223]
* FAILED event should be fired when migration fails for some reason.
[222]
* `Runtime` exception is thrown when accessing to queue after client
restarted. [220]
* Using the client, once it tries to access the cache while the cache is
unavailable, the client cannot be used anymore after the server cache
becomes available. [218]
* The methods `DistributedTask.get()` and `MultiTask.get()` throw
`OperationTimeoutException`. [217]
* There are a couple of classes that do not implement `toString`, that
makes the `Config.toString` message incomplete. [209]
* Hazelcast IMap ignores the size capacity. [188]
* Hazelcast resource adapter package (version 2.1.2) does not deploy on
JBoss 7.1.1. [182]
