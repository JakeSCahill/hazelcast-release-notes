== 3.6.3

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.3 release.

* `MapStatisticsAwareService` should obtain the map names from proxy
registry. [8209]
* Cache should not expire the entities when `Duration` value is set to
`0`. [8148], [8206]
* Collection querying in Portables. [8172]
* Type extraction by the method `extractedMultiResult` should be fixed
when the extraction result is null. [8134]
* Expiration time for the map entries should be calculated based on
their latest update times. [8111], [8113]
* Support for the usage of IAM roleâ€™s defaults should be added. [8100]
* Binary property for MultiMap should be added to XmlConfigBuilder.
[8094]
* EC2 auto-discovery in China throws an exception due to a bug in host
header handling mechanism. [8073]
* The method `Cluster.shutdown()` ignores lifecycle listeners. [8070]
* Resource adapters should not cast to implementation when using a
container to get a connection. [8019]
* Unnecessary deserialization step during the execution of put
operations should be removed. [8018]
* A URL text with spaces should not be transformed into a URI. [8016]
* Unnecessary deserialization step in the replicated map data structure
should be removed. [8014]
* When using `InstanceOfPredicate`, the method `toObject` at the server
side causes `NullPointerException`, since the class loader is not set
and it is null. Default class loader should be used if it is not set by
the configuration to avoid the exception. [7977]
* There may be cases when the server may return a list of entries larger
than the requested page size. In this case the client should not put any
anchor into the list that is on a page greater than the requested page.
[7976]
* When a remote invocation waits indefinitely on the internal executor,
a deadlock may occur since its response would use the same executor and
since the invocation monitor runs on the same executor. [7944]
* Already published messages should be retrieved after
`StaleSequenceException` occurs when `ReliableMessageListener` is
registered at the client side. [7928]
* The case of response being equal to null in the class
`ClientDelegatingFuture` should be handled. [7901]
* Detection of JCache should be improved. Currently Hazelcast checks if
the class `javax.cache.Caching` is available and, if so, Hazelcast
creates the JCache service and configures the client protocol messages.
However, some older snapshots of JCache JARs have the Caching class
available, but other classes are missing. This causes `Class not found`
exceptions when members are started. [7899]
* When connection gets an exception from the socket and the method
`destroyConnection` is called before connection is authenticated, the
client does not have an endpoint and it is not in the map of
connections. Hence, the connection cannot be closed. [7866]
* Upon subsequent destroy and create operations of IMap, there can be
more than one map container referenced by different record stores at the
same time. Therefore, indexes can be created in an unexpected map
container and this can lead to return less than expected number of
results when IMap is queried. [7838]
* After the client is shut down, there should be no invocations left.
The method `assert()` of `ClientInvocationServiceSupport` fails. [7836]

The following are the enhancements performed for 3.6.3 release.

* Phone home should include environment information, such as the
operating system name, version and kernel architecture. [7970]
* Exceptions, which are thrown when the method `isMemberSafe()` is
called, should go into finest level. When there are topology changes
some exceptions are expected. The method `getFutureResult()` should log
exceptions as `finest()`, not `warn()`. [7904]
* Protocol version should be 1 instead of 0. It was set as 0 for the
response messages. [7900]
