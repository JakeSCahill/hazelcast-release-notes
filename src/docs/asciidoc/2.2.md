This section lists the new features, enhancements and fixed issues for 2.2 release.

### New Features and Changes

The following are the new features and changes introduced with 2.2 release.

- Improved redo logs and added maximum call/operation timeout.
- Improved domain name handling; Hazelcast will use defined addresses/domain-names in TCP-IP Config as they are, without resolving an IP address.
- Added Cluster Health Check to Management Center application.

### Fixes


The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.2 release.

- The Hazelcast manual show a default config for WAN replication that includes the config item 
`<replication-impl>com.hazelcast.impl.wan.WanNoDelayReplication</replication-impl>`. This item appears to be used for configuring WAN replication implementation to be used. This item is not being used at all. Instead the replication implementation is hard coded in `WanReplicationService.java`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/152" target="_blank">[152]</a>
- It would be nice to have possibilities to instantiate native client from `java.util.Properties` and/or from classpath-located configuration file. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/93" target="_blank">[93]</a>
- The method `ILock.isLocked()` should have the ability to implement a spin lock / wait for a lock release to perform non-blocking code. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/39" target="_blank">[39]</a>
