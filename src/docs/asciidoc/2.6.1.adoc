The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.6.1 release.

- The method `set(Key, Value, 0, Timeunit)` applies the configured TTL values where it should cancel eviction. Also, the method `set(Key, Value)` should apply the inherited TTL if exists. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/585" target="_blank">[585]</a>
- Operations like `contains()` should use a specific executor service. Calling the default executor service may cause a deadlock. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/579" target="_blank">[579]</a>
- Empty array for the predicate `in` throws exception. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/573" target="_blank">[573]</a>
- The methods `ILock.destroy()` and `ISemaphore.destroy()` throw exceptions on Hazelcast 2.5. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/566" target="_blank">[566]</a>
- `NullPointerException` in `com.hazelcast.nio.ConnectionManager` in Hazelcast 2.5. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/530" target="_blank">[530]</a>
- Hazelcast instance does not start with TCP configuration in Hazelcast 2.5 when the hosts are not reachable. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/523" target="_blank">[523]</a>
- Hazelcast source archives in Maven central repository does not contain the Java source files but the class files. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/514" target="_blank">[514]</a>
- There is an unexpected store call behavior in Hazelcast 2.6. Every time when the method `get()` is used in a transaction and when the method `commit()` is called, it throws "Duplicated key order_id" exception. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/506" target="_blank">[506]</a>
- When the method `getInstances()` on HazelcastInstance is called (acquired via `HazelcastClient.newHazelcastClient(clientConfig)`), the collection is retrieved. After some time, `NullPointerException` is thrown when the same method is called. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/478" target="_blank">[478]</a>
- There are some formatting problems when using SQL predicates with date. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/473" target="_blank">[473]</a>
- There is a memory leak in the member when clients are connected. An `OutofMemoryException` is thrown related to a client authentication failure. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/450" target="_blank">[450]</a>
- Hazelcast client's `putAll()` method throws `NullPointerException` when called with an empty map. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/397" target="_blank">[397]</a>
- The `InputStream` in the `XmlConfigBuilder` can never be closed. If the constructor which provides an XML file is used, it creates a new `FileInputStream`. There is no ability to close this input stream after it is created. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/390" target="_blank">[390]</a>
- The heartbeat timer for Hazelcast client does not run again after a `NullPointerException`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/382" target="_blank">[382]</a>
- The queue `SysmteLogService.joinLogs` holds some data and causes memory consumption. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/325" target="_blank">[325]</a>
- Doing a read of a value not modified in a transaction causes the listener to fire an update for that entry. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/311" target="_blank">[311]</a>
