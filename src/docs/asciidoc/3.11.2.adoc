[[fixes-3112]]
=== Fixes

* Fixed an issue where `InitialMembershipEvent` was being fired with empty member list, when client async start is enabled. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14364[[#14364]]
* Fixed an issue where the `invokeOnPartitionsAsync()` method was not returning a value when the `memberPartitions` is empty. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14266[[#14266]]
* Removed a misleading	exception on the member side when the Java client is disconnected via the method `hazelcast.shutdown()`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14244[[#14244]]
* Difference between the clocks of target and source clusters had a potential to completely block the WAN communication which may cause the WAN queues to be filled up. This has been fixed by ignoring the call timeout check for WAN operations. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13301[[#13301]]

=== Behavioral Changes

* If you have multiple Hazelcast members on a single machine and you are using unisocket clients, we recommend you to set explicit ports for each member. Then you should provide those ports in your client configuration when you give the member addresses. Otherwise, all the load coming from your clients may go through a single member.
