== 3.6.6

The following are the fixed issues for 3.6.6 release.

* `NullPointerException` is thrown while deleting an entry through Entry
Processor by setting value to NULL. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9141[#9141]
* Indefinite reads of stale values from near cache should be prevented.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9075[#9075]
* Write behind `MapStore` is not retrying to store an entry
indefinitely. When an entry cannot be persisted, the retry mechanism
stops working after a while. This happens when the distributed map is
configured to use the write-behind mechanism. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8918[#8918]
