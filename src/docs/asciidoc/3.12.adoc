=== Enhancements

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements:_*

* **Sharing Hot Restart `base-dir` among Multiple Members:** The base directory for the Hot Restart feature (`bade-dir`) is now used as a shared directory between
multiple members, and each member uses a unique sub-directory
inside this base directory. This allows using the same configuration
on all the members. Previously, each member had to use a separate directory which complicated the deployments on cloud-like environments. During the restart, a member tries to lock an already existing Hot Restart directory inside the base directory. If it cannot acquire any, then it creates a fresh new directory. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html##configuring-hot-restart[Configuring Hot Restart section].
* **Add/Remove WAN Publishers in a Running Cluster:** Introduced the ability to dynamically add or remove WAN publishers (target clusters). See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#dynamically-adding-wan-publishers[Dynamically Adding WAN Publishers section].
* **Automatic Removal of Stale Hot Restart Data:** Introduced an option that allows the stale Hot Restart data to be removed automatically. See the description of the `auto-remove-stale-data` configuration element in the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#configuring-hot-restart[Configuring Hot Restart section].


*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements:_*

* **Client Instance Names and Attributes**: You can now retrieve the names of client instances on the member side. Moreover, client attributes have been introduced so that you can group your clients and/or perform special operations for specific clients. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12/manual/html-single/index.html#defining-client-attributes[Defining Client Attributes section].
