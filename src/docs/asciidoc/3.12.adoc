=== New Features

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise New Features:_*

* **Blue-Green and Disaster Recovery for Java Clients:** Introduced the support for Hazelcast Java clients to switch between alternative clusters. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html#blue-green-deployment-and-disaster-recovery[Blue Green Deployment and Disaster Recovery section].

*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source New Features:_*

* **CP Subsystem:** Implementing the https://raft.github.io/[Raft consensus algorithm], Hazelcast introduces its CP subsystem which runs within a Hazelcast cluster and offers linearizable implementations of Hazelcast's concurrency APIs. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html#cp-subsystem[CP Subsystem chapter].
* **Querying JSON Strings:**  You can now query JSON strings stored inside your Hazelcast clusters. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/#querying-json-strings[Querying JSON Strings section].
* **Pipelining:** Introduced pipelining mechanism using which you can send multiple requests in parallel to Hazelcast members or clients, and read the responses in a single step. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html#pipelining[Pipelining section].
* **Support for Multiple Endpoints When Configuring Member’s Networking:** Added the ability to configure the Hazelcast members with separate server sockets for different protocols. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/#advanced-network-configuration[Advanced Network Configuration section].
* **YAML Configuration Support:** Added the support for configuring Hazelcast in YAML. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/#configuring-declaratively-yaml[Configuring Declaratively with YAML section].

=== Enhancements

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements:_*

* **Sharing Hot Restart `base-dir` among Multiple Members:** The base directory for the Hot Restart feature (`base-dir`) is now used as a shared directory between
multiple members, and each member uses a unique sub-directory
inside this base directory. This allows using the same configuration
on all the members. Previously, each member had to use a separate directory which complicated the deployments on cloud-like environments. During the restart, a member tries to lock an already existing Hot Restart directory inside the base directory. If it cannot acquire any, then it creates a fresh new directory. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html##configuring-hot-restart[Configuring Hot Restart section].
* **Lower Latencies and Higher Throughput in WAN Replication:** Improved the design of the WAN replication mechanism to allow configuring it for lower latencies and higher throughput. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html##tune-wr[Tuning WAN Replication For Lower Latencies and Higher Throughput section].
* **Add/Remove WAN Publishers in a Running Cluster:** Introduced the ability to dynamically add or remove WAN publishers (target clusters). See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html#dynamically-adding-wan-publishers[Dynamically Adding WAN Publishers section].
* **Automatic Removal of Stale Hot Restart Data:** Introduced an option that allows the stale Hot Restart data to be removed automatically. See the description of the `auto-remove-stale-data` configuration element in the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html#configuring-hot-restart[Configuring Hot Restart section].
* **Client Permission Handling When a New Member Joins:** Introduced a declarative configuration attribute `on-join-operation` for the client permission in the Security configuration (its programmatic configuration equivalent is the `setOnJoinPermissionOperation()` method). This attribute allows to choose whether a new member joining to a cluster will apply the client permissions stored in its own configuration, or will use the ones defined in the cluster. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/#handling-permissions-when-a-new-member-joins[Handling Permissions When a New Member Joins section].
* **Automatic Cluster Version Change after a Rolling Upgrade:** Introduced the ability to automatically upgrade the cluster version after a rolling upgrade. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/#upgrading-cluster-version[Upgrading Cluster Version section].
* **FIPS 140-2 Validation:** Hazelcast now can be configured to use a FIPS 140-2 validated module. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/#fips-140-2[FIPS 140-2 section].

*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements:_*

* **Client Instance Names and Attributes:** You can now retrieve the names of client instances on the member side. Moreover, client attributes have been introduced so that you can group your clients and/or perform special operations for specific clients. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html#defining-client-attributes[Defining Client Attributes section].
* **Composite Indexes:** Introduced the ability to recognize the queries that use all the indexed properties and treat them as a composite, e.g., `foo = 1 and bar = 2 and foobar = 3`. See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/index.html#composite-indexes[Composite Indexes section].
* **REST Endpoint Groups:** With this enhancement you can enable or disable:
** REST API completely
** Memcache protocol
** REST endpoint groups 
+
See the https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.12-BETA-2/manual/html-single/#using-the-rest-endpoint-groups[Using the REST Endpoint Groups section].

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

**3.12-BETA-2**

* Removed group password from the Hazelcast’s default XML configuration file. Also improved the non-empty password `INFO` message. It's now only logged if security is disabled, password is not empty and password is not the Hazelcast default one. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/14603[[#14603]]

**3.12-BETA-1**

* Improved the Javadoc of `HazelcastClient` so that the code comments now use "unisocket client" instead of "dumb client". https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14213[[#14213]]
* Introduced the `/ready` endpoint to the REST API to allow checking a member if it is ready to be used after it joins to the cluster. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14089[[#14089]]
* Improved the syncing of XSD files. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14070[[#14070]]
* The `IMap.removeAll()` method now supports `PartitionPredicate`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12238[[#12238]]
* Improved the diagnostics tool so that it automatically creates the configured directory for the diagnostic outputs. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11946[[#11946]]

[[fixes-312]]

**3.12-BETA-1**

* Fixed an issue where the REST API was not handling the HTTP requests without headers correctly: when a client sends an HTTP request without headers to the Hazelcast REST API, the `HttpCommand` class was wrongly expecting an additional new line. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14353[[#14353]]
* Fixed an issue where `QueryCache` was not returning the copies of the found objects. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14280[[#14280]]
* Fixed an issue where the locks were not cleaned up after the members are restarted. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14215[[#14215]]
* Fixed an issue where the MultiMap's `RemoveOperation` was iterating through the backing collection, which caused performance degradation (when using the `SET` collection type). https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14145[[#14145]]
* Fixed an issue where the user code deployment feature was throwing `NullPointerException` while loading multiple nested classes and using entry processors. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/14105[[#14105]]

* Fixed an issue where the `addIndex()` method was performing a full copy of entries when a new member joins the cluster, which is not needed. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13964[[#13964]]
* `PagingPredicate` with comparator was failing to serialize when sending from the client or member when the cluster size is more than 1. This has been fixed by making the `PagingPredicateQuery` comparator serializable. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12208[[#12208]]
