The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.5 release.

* Map statistics are disappeared in Management Center when the member is
restarted. [9590]
* Clients are not updated when `DistributedObject` is removed from the
member. [9457], [9423]
* Hazelcast Management Center is not working with Tomcat 8 and higher.
[9452]
* `TextReadHandler` (for REST and Memcache) commands has a size
restriction. Large responses cannot be handled. There is a hardcoded
buffer size in `TextReadHandler` but it should be converted as dynamic
so that it can handle responses of any size. [9355]
* The configuration schema `hazelcast-spring.xsd` should use `<xs:all>`
instead of `<xs:sequence>` for ``hazelcast-bean'' base type. [9289]
* Stuck threads are seen in Hazelcast 3.6.2 client when session
replication is used. [9060]
* When cluster service starts when a member starts, it registers itself
as the only member and publishes the membership event. `QuorumService`
is a `MembershipAwareService`, therefore it is expected to update
quorums when it receives these membership events. The problem is as
follows: services are not registered to `ServiceManager` yet when the
cluster service publishes this event on a member start. So, it seems
that `QuorumService` is missing it and failing to update its internal
quorum status. [8820]
* Client disconnection leads to a stuck `clusterExecutor` shutdown in
Hazelcast 3.6.2. [8721]
* Near cache updates may cause `OutofMemoryException` under high load
and high number of `ICache.getAsync` calls. [8593]
* The tag `hot-restart` cannot resolve the placeholder for the value of
`enabled` and `fsync` within Spring context. [8500]
* `HazelcastInstanceAware` should be supported for `QuorumFunction`.
