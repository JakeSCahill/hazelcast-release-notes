The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.5 release.

- Map statistics are disappeared in Management Center when the member is restarted. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9590" target="_blank">[9590]</a>
- Clients are not updated when `DistributedObject` is removed from the member. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9457" target="_blank">[9457]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9423" target="_blank">[9423]</a> 
- Hazelcast Management Center is not working with Tomcat 8 and higher. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9452" target="_blank">[9452]</a>
- `TextReadHandler` (for REST and Memcache) commands has a size restriction. Large responses cannot be handled. There is a hardcoded buffer size in `TextReadHandler` but it should be converted as dynamic so that it can handle responses of any size. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9355" target="_blank">[9355]</a>
- The configuration schema `hazelcast-spring.xsd` should use `<xs:all>` instead of `<xs:sequence>` for "hazelcast-bean" base type. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9289" target="_blank">[9289]</a>
- Stuck threads are seen in Hazelcast 3.6.2 client when session replication is used. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9060" target="_blank">[9060]</a>
- When cluster service starts when a member starts, it registers itself as the only member and publishes the membership event. `QuorumService` is a `MembershipAwareService`, therefore it is expected to update quorums when it receives these membership events. The problem is as follows: services are not registered to `ServiceManager` yet when the cluster service publishes this event on a member start. So, it seems that `QuorumService` is missing it and failing to update its internal quorum status. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8820" target="_blank">[8820]</a>
- Client disconnection leads to a stuck `clusterExecutor` shutdown in Hazelcast 3.6.2. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8721" target="_blank">[8721]</a>
- Near cache updates may cause `OutofMemoryException` under high load and high number of `ICache.getAsync` calls. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8593" target="_blank">[8593]</a>
- The tag `hot-restart` cannot resolve the placeholder for the value of `enabled` and `fsync` within Spring context. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8500" target="_blank">[8500]</a>
- `HazelcastInstanceAware` should be supported for `QuorumFunction`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7499" target="_blank">[7499]</a>
