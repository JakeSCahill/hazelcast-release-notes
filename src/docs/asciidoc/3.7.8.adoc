== 3.7.8

The following is the fixed issue for 3.7.8 release.

* When the cluster state is `PASSIVE`, the background expiration task
can get an exception (in `ClearExpiredOperation`) during execution. But
after the cluster state transitions to `ACTIVE`, it should continue to
process. The taskâ€™s progress conditions should be reset in case of any
execution exception. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10636[#10636]
