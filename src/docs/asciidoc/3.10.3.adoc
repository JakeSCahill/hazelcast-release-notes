== 3.10.3

NOTE: Starting with Hazelcast 3.10.3, Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise license keys are required only for members. You do not need to set a license key for your Java clients for which you want to use Enterprise features.


=== Fixes

*  Hazelcast client produces `OutOfMemoryError` when there is no Hazelcast member available at startup. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13186[[#13186]]
