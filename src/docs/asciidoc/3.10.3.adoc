== 3.10.3

NOTE: Starting with Hazelcast 3.10.3, Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise license keys are required only for members. You do not need to set a license key for your Java clients for which you want to use Enterprise features.


=== Enhancements

* Descriptive null checks should be added when accessing a data structure on the client. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13256[[#13256]]

=== Fixes

* Setting `ExpirationTimeMergePolicy` throws exception during configuration validation. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13392[[#13392]]
* When a cache is closed, it is no longer managed by the `CacheManager`;
its `CacheManager` should be reset to null and the method `getCacheManager()` should
return null as per specification. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13236[[#13236]]
*  Hazelcast client produces `OutOfMemoryError` when there is no Hazelcast member available at startup. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13186[[#13186]]

=== Removed/Deprecated Features

* The method 'ClientConfig.setLicenseKey()' is deprecated.
