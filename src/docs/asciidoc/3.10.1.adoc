[[fixes-3101]]
=== Fixes

* The method `readManyAsync()` throws different exceptions when there is no quorum: The client fails with `QuorumException`, and member fails with `ExecutionException`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/13065[#13065]
* It is expected to get `HazelcastSerializationException` from the method `future.get()`, however, it hangs when the response is not serializable. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12956[#12956]
* `CachePutBackupOperation`: When an entry is evicted on the primary member, it is also evicted on the backup members. This causes the method `LocalCacheStats.getCacheEvictions()` to return incorrect numbers. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12931[#12931]
* The connections to the members after they are removed from the cluster should be closed. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12926[#12926]
