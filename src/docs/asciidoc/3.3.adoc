3.3 release.

=== New Features

The following are the new features introduced with 3.3 release.

* Heartbeat for Java client: Before this release, a Java client could
not detect a node as dead, if the client is not trying to connect to it.
With this heartbeat feature, each node will be pinged periodically. If
no response is returned from a node, it will be deemed as dead. Main
goal of this feature is to decrease the time for detection of dead
(disconnected) nodes by Java clients, so that the user operations will
be sent directly to a responsive one. For more information, please see
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/#client-properties[Client
Properties].
* Tomcat 6 and 7 Web Sessions Clustering: Please see
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#web-session-replication[Web
Session Replication].
* Replicated Map implemented: Please see
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#replicated-map[Replicated
Map]
* WAN Replication improved: Added configurable replication queue size
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#wan-replication-queue-size[WAN
Replication Queue Size].
* Data Aggregation implemented: Added common data aggregations, please
find
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#aggregators[Aggregators]
documentation.
* EvictAll and LoadAll features for IMap: `evictAll` and `loadAll`
methods have been introduced to be able to evict all entries except the
locked ones and that loads all or a set of keys from a configured map
store, respectively. Please see
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#evicting-all-entries[Evicting
All Entries] and
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#forcing-all-keys-to-be-loaded[Forcing
All Keys to be Loaded] sections for more information.
* Hazelcast JCache implementation introduced: Starting with release
3.3.1, Hazelcast offers its JCache implementation. Please see
http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.3/manual/html-single/hazelcast-documentation.html#hazelcast-jcache-implementation[Hazelcast
JCache Implementation] for details.
