See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1/manual/html-single/index.html#???[??? section^].

*_Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements:_*

* **Improvements in Partial Network Disconnections:** Introduced properties
to be configured to detect and resolve the partial network issues among the
Hazelcast IMDG members.
See link:https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16680[#16680^] and the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1/manual/html-single/index.html#???[??? section^].
* **Trusted Interfaces:** It is now possible to restrict the source IP addresses
from which the Management Center operations are allowed.
See the link:https://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/4.1/manual/html-single/#limiting-source-addresses[Limiting Source Addresses section^].

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement
issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

* Implemented the `root` operator for the SQL engine
responsible for getting the final result stream.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16829[#16829]
* Added support for `IMap.computeIfAbsent()`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16808[#16808]
* Introduced SQL thread pools for query processing.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16805[#16805]
* Introduced the network protocol, base executor and row
interfaces for the SQL engine.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16799[#16799],
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16762[#16762]
* Added the creation time metric for the executor service.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16775[#16775]
* Improved an unclear exception message for credentials.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16756[#16756]
* Defined metrics for ISet and IList collections.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16665[#16665]
* Renamed MultiMap proxy implementation to follow the established naming convention:
`ObjectMultiMapProxy` -> `MultiMapProxyImpl`.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/16637[#16637]
* Made `IMap.putAllAsync()` and `IMap.submitToKeys()` methods public API.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/16449[#16449]
* Implemented the base type system for SQL: the base SQL data types
have been defined and mapped to the corresponding Java types.
Type information is used by executor stages to use the right strategy
of expression evaluation.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15241[#15241]
* Clarified the exception message when you connect to a cluster with an
invalid group name.
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/15099[#15099]
* Added a test for the `ClientConsoleApp` class. 
https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12298[#12298]
* Improved the behavior of `ConcurrentMap.computeIfPresent`:
combined single client-server round trips instead of two (for `get` and
`replace` methods).
