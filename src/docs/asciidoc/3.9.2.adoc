=== Enhancements

* Expiration operations can be stopped/canceled during the `SHUTTING_DOWN` state. Otherwise it causes graceful shutdowns which take longer, especially on clusters with a large amount of data, e.g., High-Density Memory Store backed maps. It is not necessary to block the shutdown for these operations since it will eventually be handled on the new owner of the entries. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11919[#11919]
* Changed Hazelcast base images from Debian to Alpine Linux. Hence, the size of the image is reduced. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast-docker/pull/48[#48]

[[fixes-392]]
=== Fixes

* `PartitionPredicate` on `MapAggregation` throws exception when it is called from the client. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11923[#11923]
* Some client `TransactionalMap` operations deserializes on the server side, while `IMap.values()` does not do so. This causes serialization exceptions on a client-member setup when members do not have the serialization information, e.g., in case where portables are used. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11885[#11885]
* Replicated map's Javadoc contains only member behaviors/requirements which the client cannot meet due to its technical difference. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11707[#11707]
* Ringbuffer access throws HazelcastInstanceNotActiveException when cluster state is PASSIVE. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11664[#11664]

==== Coverity Fixes

* The method `addressTranslator.translate(target)` of `com.hazelcast.client.connection.nio.ClientConnectionManagerImpl.InitConnectionTask.run()` may return null. The returned value is used as an argument for the method `createSocketConnection(Address)` which uses the value without a null-check. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11771[#11771]
