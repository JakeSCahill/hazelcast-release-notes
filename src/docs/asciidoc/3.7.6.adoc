== 3.7.6

The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.6 release.

* In the case of using multiple lite members with near cache, when a
`clear` is called it tries to use the same operation and results in
`IllegalStateException`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9879[#9879]
* Near cache eviction does not work. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9723[#9723]
* Connection exception is logged in `ClientListenerSupport` after the
client disconnects. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9709[#9709]
* IMap entry eviction issue; some keys stay forever. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9095[#9095]
