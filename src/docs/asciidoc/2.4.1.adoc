=== Fixes

The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.4.1 release.

* After a split-brain syndrome, states sent by a non-member should be
ignored. [374]
* Indexing: Negative double values comparison causes problems in SQL
predicate. [368]
* Query on Hazelcast IMap with indexes returns stale data. [359]
* By default, the method `map.clear()` clears the map entry by entry
since the entries should be checked if they have a related lock, should
be persisted, etc. If you do not use map store and can assume that there
is no locked entries, then there should be an option to clear the map
directly. [356]
* System logs should be optional. [351]
* Management center should show the Hazelcast version. [349]
* `UnsupportedOperationException` is thrown when the method
`getConfig()` is called during the startup of the web application. Used
versions are Hazelcast 2.4 and Hibernate 3.6.6. [339]
* Documentation is wrong. Hazelcast supports `REPEATABLE_READ` instead
of `READ_COMMITTED`. [337]
* When you need a lite member, since it cannot be specified in the
configuration file, you need to do the whole loading mechanism yourself.
[333]
* In the local map statistics, currently there is only `getHits()`.
There should be statistics for misses (get requests which return null)
to see hit/miss ratio. [328]
* When Hazelcast OSGi bundle is used in Glassfish 3.1.2,
`ClassNotFoundException` is thrown. [322]
* The method `MapConfig.toString()` should report `mapIndexConfig` too.
[321]
* When the connection between the client and member is lost, the client
does not notice it and tries to send the data for a very long time and
it does not shut down.[315]
* Hazelcast tends to consume large amounts of memory in
`com.hazelcast.nio.Packet` instances. [312]
* Map index entries are not deleted upon migration. When using SQL
predicate in the method `localKeySet()`, the same key can be retrieved
on different nodes. [308]
* Hazelcast IMap entries are evicted even they are touched by the method
`put()`. [466]
