== 2.4

This section lists the new features, enhancements and fixed issues for
2.4 release.

=== New Features

The following are the new features introduced with 2.4 release.

* Client threads does not have fixed size anymore, now it uses internal
Hazelcast cached thread pool.
* Added ability to restrict outbound ports that Hazelcast uses to
connect to other nodes.

=== Fixes

The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.4 release.

* Hazelcast Management Centerâ€™s ``Configuration has been successfully
updated.'' notification is never removed. [301]
* Map maximum size does not take into account that some cluster members
are lite members and cannot hold any data. Thus, the map becomes smaller
than the size it was configured. [292]
* The method `map.containsKey()` does not reset the idle time counter.
[288]
* In Hazelcast 2.3.1, the property `hazelcast.local.localAddress` is
used only when provided directly from `System.properties`. [282]
* Data removed under transaction sometimes could not be removed from the
backup. [277]
* Map initialization should not use the default executor service. [276]
* In Hazelcast 2.3.1, Hazelcast got into a state where the list of
members on some of the nodes do not match up. [274]
* Map `EntryListener` is not working correctly if one master is
restarted. [269]
* `IMap.tryLockAndGet`: There is a concurrency error when the map has
map store. [268]
* Error in `com.hazelcast.query.Predicates.NotEqualPredicate`. [262]
* Partition Group with group type CUSTOM should honor configured
backups. [260]
* Messages are lost while moving them inside a transaction. [259]
* Enable Hazelcast to use specified port ranges to accommodate firewall
policies. [251]
* Seeing multiple concurrent locks on a distributed lock. [168]
