The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.4 release.

* Client protocol should be updated to support old .NET clients that
have an issue preventing them to connect to 3.7.3 and newer clusters.
[9388]
* Fixed `keyStateMarker` problems. [9382]
* When nodes terminates concurrently, clusterService.removeAddress can
fail because target node is already shutdown. [9324]
* Cache event listeners trigger multiple events when the listener is
configured declaratively (XML). [9315]
* When client is connected and the client process is paused, e.g., using
a debugger, then the member starts printing the warning message
(`Client heartbeat is timed out`) every 10 seconds. [9308]
* Hazelcast client outside the AWS cloud cannot connect to Hazelcast
member inside the AWS cloud. [9290]
* In case of a retrying operation, an old heartbeat could still be
stored on the invocation. If the invocation monitor sees this, it does
not understand that this is from an old invocation. It concludes that
the invocation has not received any recent heartbeats and aborts the
invocation. [9287]
* Client endpoint may have a different connection than the one it was
initially constructed. [9282]
* The method `loadAll(keys)` has to notify `RecordStores` about the end
of loading. [9260]
* Partitions should be unavailable/inaccessible until
`MigrationAwareServices` complete commit/rollback during migration
and/or promotion. [9235]
* When backups are reordered and a backup with a version greater than
(localVersion + 1) is received, backup is applied but partition replica
versions are not updated. [9206]
