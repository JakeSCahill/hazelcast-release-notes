## Enhancements

- **Ping Failure Detector for Hazelcast Java Client:** Ping Failure Detector provides a quicker and more deterministic detection of hardware and other lower level events. It has been available for Hazelcast members; now, it can also be used for Hazelcast Java clients. The related PR is [[#12049]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12049). Please see the [Client Ping Failure Detector section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9.3/manual/html-single/index.html#client-ping-failure-detector).

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- Enhancements in the WAN Diagnostics: Introduced latency tracking for WAN endpoints and 
counters for sent and received WAN events. Please note that WAN Replication is an Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Edition feature. [[#12615]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12165)
- Introduced a system property to allow overriding the configured serialization byte order for better testing. [[#12145]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12145)
- Performed updates for JCache 1.1 compatibility. [[#12014]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12014)




## Fixes

- `CacheMergeOperation` does not publish WAN events. [[#12186]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12186)
- Java serialization compression issue: Since GZipInputStream read more bytes than it needs, the fields coming after a compressed data is not able to be read. [[#12104]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12104)
- Setting the property `hazelcast.mc.max.visible.instance.count` to `Integer.MAX` or a huge value causes OOME. [[#12095]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12095)
- The Javadoc for `SHUFFLE_MEMBER_LIST` in the class `ClientProperty` is not correct. The shuffling is done when the related property (`hazelcast.client.shuffle.member.list`) is set to `true`. Also the description in the Hazelcast Reference Manual should be corrected accordingly. [[#12082]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12082)
- Endianness not taken into account consistently for serializer type IDs. [[#12077]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12077)
- Hazelcast client throws "AuthenticationException: Invalid credentials after owner member left". Clients should detect when a member is gone ungracefully. [[#12038]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12038)
- Query results should be converted to OBJECT in-memory format while creating the query-result-set, if the transaction is not originated from the client. [[#12050]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12050)
- IMap's `aggregate`, `projection`, `localKeySet` and `executeOnEntries` methods throws exception when `PartitionPredicate` is being used. [[#11962]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11962)
- There is a race condition in the client's Near Cache: "File is already being used by this Hazelcast instance". This was caused by the a problem with the synchronization between Near Cache creation and the `destroy` inside the Near Cache manager. [[#11648]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11648)
- The map screen of Management Center does not show throughput info for `TransactionalMap`s. [[#11640]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11640)


## Behavioral Changes

- Default value of the system property `hazelcast.mc.max.visible.instance.count` changed from 100 to Integer.MAX_VALUE. So you may see more than usual data in your Management Center, if you have more than 100 data structures in your Hazelcast cluster.
