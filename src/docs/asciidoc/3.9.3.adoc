=== Enhancements

- **Ping Failure Detector for Hazelcast Java Client:** Ping Failure Detector provides a quicker and more deterministic detection of hardware and other lower level events. It has been available for Hazelcast members; now, it can also be used for Hazelcast Java clients. The related PR is https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12049[[#12049]]. Please see the http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9.3/manual/html-single/index.html#client-ping-failure-detector[Client Ping Failure Detector section].

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- Enhancements in the WAN Diagnostics: Introduced latency tracking for WAN endpoints and 
counters for sent and received WAN events. Please note that WAN Replication is an Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Edition feature. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12165[[#12615]]
- Introduced a system property to allow overriding the configured serialization byte order for better testing. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12145[[#12145]]
- Performed updates for JCache 1.1 compatibility. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/12014[[#12014]]




=== Fixes

- `CacheMergeOperation` does not publish WAN events. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12186[[#12186]]
- Java serialization compression issue: Since GZipInputStream read more bytes than it needs, the fields coming after a compressed data is not able to be read. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12104[[#12104]]
- Setting the property `hazelcast.mc.max.visible.instance.count` to `Integer.MAX` or a huge value causes OOME. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12095[[#12095]]
- The Javadoc for `SHUFFLE_MEMBER_LIST` in the class `ClientProperty` is not correct. The shuffling is done when the related property (`hazelcast.client.shuffle.member.list`) is set to `true`. Also the description in the Hazelcast Reference Manual should be corrected accordingly. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12082[[#12082]]
- Endianness not taken into account consistently for serializer type IDs. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12077[[#12077]]
- Hazelcast client throws "AuthenticationException: Invalid credentials after owner member left". Clients should detect when a member is gone ungracefully. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12038[[#12038]]
- Query results should be converted to OBJECT in-memory format while creating the query-result-set, if the transaction is not originated from the client. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12050[[#12050]]
- IMap's `aggregate`, `projection`, `localKeySet` and `executeOnEntries` methods throws exception when `PartitionPredicate` is being used. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11962[[#11962]]
- There is a race condition in the client's Near Cache: "File is already being used by this Hazelcast instance". This was caused by the a problem with the synchronization between Near Cache creation and the `destroy` inside the Near Cache manager. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11648[[#11648]]
- The map screen of Management Center does not show throughput info for `TransactionalMap`s. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11640[[#11640]]


=== Behavioral Changes

- Default value of the system property `hazelcast.mc.max.visible.instance.count` changed from 100 to Integer.MAX_VALUE. So you may see more than usual data in your Management Center, if you have more than 100 data structures in your Hazelcast cluster.
