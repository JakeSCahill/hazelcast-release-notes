=== Enhancements

*_Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements:_*


* **Fine-Grained Control over WAN Replication Events**: Introduced the new event type `LOADED` and the class `EntryLoadedListener` through which all the loads can be listened to. Also introduced the new configuration element `persist-wan-replicated-data` to specify whether to persist an incoming event over WAN replication or not. See http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.11/manual/html-single/index.html#configuring-consumer[Configuring Consumer section].

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

* `WanPublisherConfigDTO` does not handle discovery strategies, so cloud deployed clusters utilizing cloud discovery, like AWS for WAN, cannot be created dynamically. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12505[[#12505]]
* `MigrationRequestOperation` must be improved with the new Offload abstraction. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11989[[#11989]]
* Multicast discovery strategy needs some improvements: either a shared codebase by discovery SPI and native implementation, or only one implementation keeping both configuration options (`multicast` or `discovery-strategies`) should be used. Also an easier client based multicast discovery option should be promoted. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/11357[[#11357]]
* The current IMap interface for the operation of putting a value into a map is not clear where the resulting value of the entry's TTL is concerned. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10845[[#10845]]
* There should be a more proper way of heap-data conversion; currently `ToHeapDataConverter` is being used. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10249[[#10249]]
* When writing a `DiscoveryStrategy` that extends `AbstractDiscoveryStrategy`, the Hazelcast instance that invokes this strategy cannot be accessed. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/6811[[#6811]]
* The method `EntryListener.entryAdded()` is not called after `IMap.evict()` is triggered followed by the method `IMap.get()`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/1542[[#1542]]
 



=== Fixes

* `SerializationServiceBuilder` ignores the method `useNativeByteOrder()`. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13410[[#13410]]
* Attribute extractor does not fallback to user code deployment: it does not use user code deployment to search for the extractor implementation. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13400[[#13400]]
* Built-in predicate implementations do not implement equals/hashCode. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13245[[#13245]]
* `EOFException` is thrown when using `PagingPredicate` with Kryo in Hazelcast 3.8.7. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13147[[#13147]]
* Setting an exception in an IAtomicReference causes it to be thrown when getting it. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/13138[[#13138]]
* The exception `Cannot override cache's CacheManager` is thrown after the restart of remote Hazelcast. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12975[[#12975]]
* When a member is killed, events are lost and the method `QueryCache.tryRecover()` is triggered in a loop even if data is not lost. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12928[[#12928]]
* `Ringbuffer.readManyAsync()`: Client unwraps the `ExecutionException` before throwing it to the user code. The member never does it. It also does not happen on other async proxies. Client should not unwrap. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/12108[[#12108]]
* The method `MapLoader.load()` does not create an entry event, as it is essentially a get operation. But, the method `MapLoader.loadAll()` uses `IMap.putTransient()` and so it generates `EntryAdded` events. This is inconsistent and the latter is problematic for WAN replicated clusters. https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7771[[#7771]]


==== Coverity Fixes

* ???


=== Behavioral Changes

* WAN Replication: `LOADED` events are filtered out and not replicated by default anymore.



=== Known Problems

* ???


=== Removed/Deprecated Features

* The data structure `IdGenerator` is removed. ???. Use http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.11/manual/html-single/index.html#flakeidgenerator[Flake ID Generator]. ???
* Following system properties are removed:
** `hazelcast.master.confirmation.interval.seconds`
** `hazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds`
** `hazelcast.mc.max.visible.instance.count`
