The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.1 release.

- Behavior of JCache near cache invalidation events changed: (i) the method `Cache.close` now delivers near cache invalidation events, (ii) the method `Cache.destroy` no longer delivers invalidation events, (iii) the method `CacheManager.destroyCache` when invoked from a client-side cache manager no longer delivers invalidation events. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8801" target="_blank">[8801]</a>
- Aggressive SQL predicate flattening may result in wrong parsing of SQL. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8799" target="_blank">[8799]</a>
- To properly configure within Spring context, incorrect client defaults should be fixed. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8761" target="_blank">[8761]</a>
- `NullPointerException` is thrown when the class `DefaultNodeExtension` has been loaded by two different class loaders. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8755" target="_blank">[8755]</a>
- `HazelcastInstanceNotActive` exception is thrown which is misleading. When a remote member is shutdown while destroying a proxy, no warnings should be logged. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8736" target="_blank">[8736]</a>
- Test failure fixes: <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8702" target="_blank">[8702]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8694" target="_blank">[8694]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8460" target="_blank">[8460]</a>, <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7022" target="_blank">[7022]</a>
- Missing dependency for JSPC plugin should be added. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/management-center/pull/297" target="_blank">[297]</a>
