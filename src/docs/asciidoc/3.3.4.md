The following are the fixed issues for 3.3.4 release.


- Predicate with short values is not working [[#4293]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4293).
- Hits statistics copy and paste error in the method `ReplicatedRecord` [[#4254]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4254).
- Serialization error on the ReplicatedMap when in-memory format is set to `BINARY` [[#4205]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4205).
- Too long exception stacktraces if the Hazelcast client fails to receive data, and this leads to a failure on the client [[#4192]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4192).
- Hazelcast client registers the translated public address instead of its own private address to the list of connections. This causes the client not to be able to remove the connection correctly [[#4190]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4190).
- `TransactionType:Local` emits exceptions while committing. The normal behavior should be throwing the exceptions to the user [[#4160]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4160).
- Map replication should mark expirable recordstore. Otherwise, in some situations, if one does not set the map wide expiration or map wide TTL, the key based TTL expiration may not work [[#4144]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4144).
- The method `BasicInvocationFuture.response` should be cleared when `BasicInvocation.WAIT_RESPONSE` is read by the waiter thread. Otherwise, when the retry operation takes too much time, the waiting thread sees the same wait response multiple times and the operation may not timeout forever [[#4123]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4123).
- Topic listeners should be unregistered when topic is destroyed [[#4117]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4117).
- Invocations (and their operations) remain in the invocations map forever if the operation timeouts without a response [[#4113]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4113).
- Timeout is needed for parallel query operations [[#4074]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4074).
- Initial map load and `max-size-policy` conflict [[#4066]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4066).
- MapStore operations should be retried and performed eventually after a temporary failure [[#4061]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4061).
-  The class `SynchronizedWriteBehindQueue` (from `com.hazelcast.map.mapstore.writebehind`
package) is declared threadsafe in JavaDocs, but it is not [[#4039]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4039).
- The method `RemoveIfSameOperation` does not set `dataOldValue` for the `entryRemoved` event  [[#4037]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4037).
- When a new node with a new field is added to a cluster and when a query over this node is attempted, the old nodes throw an exception (`com.hazelcast.query.QueryException: Unknown Portable field: newFieldName`) and the query fails by throwing the same exception. [[#3927]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3927).
- At the moment, the internal state fields of a `Reducer` are required to be volatile to ensure the memory visibility effects after the suspension and continuation of a reducer. This requirement should be moved to be handled by the framework itself since it is tend to be forgotten [[#3866]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3866).
- The method `executeOnKey` hangs when the server fails to handle a query [[#3842]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3842).
- The `GlobalSerializerConfig#setImplementation()` parameter should be compatible with the implementation field [[#3569]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3569).
- `ClientConsoleApp` should not define the file `hazelcast-client.xml` [[#3554]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3554).
- When using a custom partitioning strategy and the configured backup count of a map cannot be fulfilled since a node defined in the custom partition group is down, a JMX service call is blocked in the while-loop at `com.hazelcast.map.MapService.createLocalMapStats` [[#3526]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/3526).
