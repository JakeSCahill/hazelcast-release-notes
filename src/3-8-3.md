# 3.8.3

The following are the fixed issues for Hazelcast 3.8.3 release.

- Hazelcast 3.8.1: calling `replace(K, old, new)` keeps the expiry time as creation time + duration. But Hazelcast doesn't seem to honor this expiration even after calling `get()`. [[#10817]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10817)
- When using a client side Near Cache, the cache statistics seem incorrect when asking for a key that doesn't exist. [[#10806]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10806)
- Ringbuffer is not adjusting `headSeq` while setting `tailSeq` due to capacity. [[#10774]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10774)
- Older versions of Mulesoft clash with Hazelcast Client classpath. [[#10706]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10706)
- In the case when the master node is terminated in the middle of a 2-phase transaction, the rollback for that transaction is not performed. This causes loss of data. [[#10637]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10637)
- Adding/removing listeners fails if a member is removed in the progress. [[#10595]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10595)
- When two callbacks are registered as callback to `ClientDelegatingFuture`, if one of them wants to deserialize the response while the other is does not, Hazelcast falsely gives null response to the one waiting a deserialized value. [[#10581]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10581)
- Eviction and `max-size` for less then 271 cause map to never populate. [[#10179]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10179)
- `IOException` at the client side must be produced only if `hazelcast.client.invocation.timeout.seconds` is passed. [[#9696]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9696)
