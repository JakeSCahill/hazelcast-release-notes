# 3.8.3

The following are the fixed issues for Hazelcast 3.8.3 release.

- In the case when the master node is terminated in the middle of a 2-phase transaction, the rollback for that transaction is not performed. This causes loss of data. [[#10637]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10637)
- Adding/removing listeners fails if a member is removed in the progress. [[#10595]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10595)
