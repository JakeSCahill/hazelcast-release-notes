# 3.8.2

The following are the fixed issues for Hazelcast 3.8.2 release.

- Even though a `CachePermission` already exists, the respective `PermissionType` does not exist and cannot be configured programmatically or declaratively. [[#10503]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10503)
- Management Center reports incorrect values for backups. Given that there is one copy of the data across a native map, it is expected to see identical memory footprint on the entry and the backups with identical sum across a server. But it is not the case. [[#10454]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10454)
- There is a memory leak caused by `ThreadGroup`. [[#10394]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10394)
- Split-Brain messages still occupy the memory after recovery. [[#10325]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10325)
- When shutting down a client with a topic subscription, it logs a warning level exception which seems harmless. It is not good to log a harmless exception as warning. [[#10291]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10291)
- There is a race condition in the back pressure at the client side which causes the back pressure not to work. [[#10253]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10253)
- Ringbuffer OutOfMemoryError: GC overhead limit exceeded. [[#10189]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10189)
- `ClientContext` is created for every proxy and it causes unneeded resource allocations. [[#10117]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10117)
- Hazelcast terminates listeners incorrectly. [[#10101]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10101)
- When hostname is used in the Hazelcast member configuration instead of IP address, `NullPointerException` is thrown. [[#9884]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9884)
- When using a Hazelcast Client instance, if the `redoOperation` is set to true, operations which failed to be sent to the cluster are retried, but failures from executing the operation itself in the cluster are not. [[#8545]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8545)

## Behavioral Changes

- Starting with 3.8.2, members with the same group name but with different group passwords (that do not use authentication) forms a cluster. Before this release, group passwords needed to be the same too.
