- **???: ???. Please refer to the [??? section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-dev/manual/html-single/index.html#???).


The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- It would be better to have a way where near cache notifications for each entry are disabled, but an ability to enable/disable notifications of full-flush events (clear, etc.). <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7580" target="_blank">[7580]</a>

- Hazelcast should support Transaction API of Spring. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7469" target="_blank">[7469]</a>

- Async put operations should be reflected at near cache as soon as the method `future.get()` returns. In the case of async put operations and `LocalUpdatePolicy` being `CACHE` at the client side, entries are put to the near cache asynchronously from another task when the response is received. But with this way, when `future.get()` returns, entry might not be inside the near cache (but it will be there eventually). <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7155" target="_blank">[7155]</a>

- ICache.iterator() fetchSize is not configurable. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7580" target="_blank">[7580]</a>

- Inconsistency between the declarative and programmatic configuration of network elements should be solved. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/945 target="_blank">[945]</a>

- The class `MigrationEndpoint` should be a part of Hazelcast SPI package. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/1427 target="_blank">[1427]</a>

- It would be nice if the type parameters of `Predicate` were inherited by the `IndexAwarePredicate`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/1686 target="_blank">[1686]</a>



## Fixes

The following are the fixed issues solved for 3.7 release.

**3.7 Fixes**



- If you setup an interceptor to change the data being inserted, the entry listeners still fire with the old value. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7991" target="_blank">[7991]</a>


- The method `IMap.executeOnKeys()` does not support the empty set (it throws a misleading `NullPointerException`), and is inconsistent with the method `getAll()`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7631" target="_blank">[7631]</a>



- Replicated map updates take a very long time. The problematic method is `putAll()`. The replication logic in this method checks whether the data owners are in sync with the replicas. If they are not, this logic syncs them every 30 seconds. This means, when the updates are not replicated to callers, it takes up to 30 seconds to make all the members synchronized. This period should be configurable. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7617" target="_blank">[7617]</a>



- `ScheduledExecutorServiceDelegate` violates contract of `ScheduledExecutorService`. It wraps tasks in `ScheduledTaskRunner` which delegates to a different executor. As a consequence, a task can be executed concurrently and this is a violation of a contract of `ScheduledExecutorService`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7611" target="_blank">[7611]</a>



- There is an inconsistent behavior when removing from `TransactionalMap` while the key is locked on IMap. In order to avoid trying to remove an entry that may have already been removed in another uncommitted transaction, `IMap.tryLock` is used before performing `TransactionalMap.remove`. This works as expected if the operations occur on a member. But a `TransactionException` is thrown when it occurs on a client when using XA Transaction. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7587" target="_blank">[7587]</a>



- Hazelcast instance should be exposed through `com.hazelcast.spring.cache.HazelcastCacheManager`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7571" target="_blank">[7571]</a>



- Instance name should not be overridden while creating cache manager from the specified configuration file. Also, it would be better to specify instance name via (]`HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_INSTANCE_NAME` property when instance configuration is taken from the specified configuration file via `HazelcastCachingProvider.HAZELCAST_CONFIG_LOCATION`.<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7567" target="_blank">[7567]</a>



- The `addInterceptor()` method in `com.hazelcast.map.impl.MapContainer()` is not thread safe. For example, if two concurrent attempts are made to inject the same interceptor, these will be different interceptor objects with the same ID. In this case, the call to `interceptorMap.put(id, interceptor)` will increase the map size by one, but the call to `interceptors.add(interceptor)` will increase the list size by two. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7520" target="_blank">[7520]</a>



- There are unused elements for Management Center configuration: `cluster-id` and `security-token`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7446" target="_blank">[7446]</a>



- For clients, `InitialMembershipListener.init` is called after `MembershipListener.memberAdded`. This contradicts the content in the Reference Manual.  <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7430" target="_blank">[7430]</a>



- DiscoveryService's `start` and `destroy` methods should be called during the start and shutdown of client when Discovery SPI is enabled. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7347" target="_blank">[7347]</a>
