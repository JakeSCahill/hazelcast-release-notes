# 3.7.3

The following are the fixed issues for 3.7.3 release.

  
- The `scheduler` in `TcpIpConnectionManager` is not completing after the method `instance.shutdown()` is called. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9187" target="_blank">[9187]</a>
- `EntryView`'s `storeTime` and `expirationTime` are not available even though they are set. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9166" target="_blank">[9166]</a>
- `NullPointerException` is thrown while deleting an entry through Entry Processor by setting value to NULL. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9135" target="_blank">[9135]</a>
- There is a discrepancy between the Reference Manual and source code in the default value of `hazelcast.heartbeat.interval.seconds`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9070" target="_blank">[9070]</a>
- When Hazelcast is upgraded from 3.6.5 to 3.7.1, calls to Spring cache generate exceptions. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9023" target="_blank">[9023]</a>
- Hazelcast 3.6.x client cannot obtain cache proxy from 3.7.x cluster. Configuration creation and retrieval seem to be not working on 3.6.x clients when they connect to a 3.7.x cluster. Two new system properties added, namely `hazelcast.compatibility.3.6.server` and `hazelcast.compatibility.3.6.client`. When upgrading from (assuming that you are using ICache) 3.6.x to 3.7.3 then the servers should be started with `-Dhazelcast.compatibility.3.6.client=true` to enable existing 3.6.x clients work properly. When upgrading from 3.7.1 and 3.7.2 to 3.7.3 this is not needed.<a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9006" target="_blank">[9006]</a>
- When clients lose connection to the nodes in the cluster, even after the clients reconnected to the cluster, the Entry/MessageListeners never fired again. When you register a listener, the registration to the members are invoked with a timeout value of connection-timeout. Keeping this value short can cause a timeout exception during a listener registration. Therefore, you may need to increase the default value (i.e. 5 seconds), please refer to the [Setting Connection Timeout section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest/manual/html-single/index.html#setting-connection-timeout). <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8847" target="_blank">[8847]</a>
- There is an unnecessary warning about member side near cache invalidation operations. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8841" target="_blank">[8841]</a>
- MapLoader.loadAll(true) doesn't reload after reloading with given keys <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9255" target="_blank">[9255]</a>
