## Enhancements


The following are the enhancements introduced with 3.9 release.

- **???**: Please refer to <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9/manual/html-single/index.html#???" target="_blank">???</a>.

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- The attribute `override-java-serialization` should be added to the element `global-serializer` in `hazelcast-client-config.xsd`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10449" target="_blank">[10449]</a>
- Hazelcast should have a method like `gerOrCreateHazelcastInstance()` to detect a default configuration file and either create an instance or get an existing one. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10007" target="_blank">[10007]</a>
- Allow binding any port without using the method `setPortAutoIncrement()` and specifying the port count. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9775" target="_blank">[9775]</a>
- When a grid member is configured to use port 0, it should be handled properly. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2506" target="_blank">[2506]</a>


## Fixes

The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.9 release.

- Scheduled task remains cancelled after migration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10603" target="_blank">[10603]</a>
- WAN backup events are published twice. The `publishWanReplicationEventBackups` method is called in the `run` and `afterRun` method in the `PartitionWideEntryBackupOperation`. Elsewhere it is only called in `afterRun`. This needs to be checked but possibly the fix is just to remove the call in `run`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10457" target="_blank">[10457]</a>
- Source parameter is null on `JCache.loadAll()` call. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10328" target="_blank">[10328]</a>
- `TcpIpJoiner` throws the exception`ConcurrentModificationException: null`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10207" target="_blank">[10207]</a>
- It seems like the Near Cache statistics seem to be off-by-one for at least the `ownedEntryCount`. Sometimes the `ownedEntryMemoryCost` seems to be affected as well. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10193" target="_blank">[10193]</a>
- Setting up a Hazelcast listener in a Spring configuration format does not seem to work when using the class property of `hz:listener`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10154" target="_blank">[10154]</a>
- Test coverage for `NearCacheClientCacheProxy` should be increased. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10127" target="_blank">[10127]</a>
- Hazelcast XML configuration does not allow `RANDOM` eviction as an eviction policy. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10053" target="_blank">[10053]</a>
- There is a race condition in `TestClientRegistry` where the tests are calling `blockFrom` and `blockTo` before any connection was made (via `createSocketConnection`). This causes `NullPointerException` in those block methods. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10021" target="_blank">[10021]</a>
- When health check is enabled, the user can send a garbage request like `http://<your member's host IP>:5701/hazelcast/healthqqq` and it returns a correct response. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9967" target="_blank">[9967]</a>
- Durable Executor Service re-executes the completed tasks in case of a member failure. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9965" target="_blank">[9965]</a>
- The option `cache-local-entries` is not supported at the client side Near Cache configuration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9712" target="_blank">[9712]</a>
- Latest member-list may not be received when `FinalizeJoinOperation` invocation timeouts. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9501" target="_blank">[9501]</a>
- Cluster member-list update operations are not ordered, new member addition and removal operations can get reordered on receiving/processing side. Also periodic member-list publish operation has no order with other member adding/removing operations. That can cause having different member lists on different members. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9486" target="_blank">[9486]</a>
