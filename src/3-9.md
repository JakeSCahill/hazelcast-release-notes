- **WAN Replication on Amazon EC2**: With this new feature, you can run multiple clusters within EC2 environment without manually configuring IP addresses and use Hazelcast's WAN replication to keep them in sync.


##### Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Features

- **Dynamic Creation of Distributed Objects Configuration**: You can perform on the fly configuration of your distributed objects.



## Enhancements


The following are the enhancements introduced with 3.9-EA release.

##### Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements


- **Dynamic Role Update**: You can update security permissions in a running cluster without the performing a rolling restart.
- **Search Indexes in High-Density Memory Store**: Now, sorted and unsorted indexes for High-Density Memory Store are supported.
- **Members-only License Installation**: Licenses are installed only at the member side, not the client side.


##### Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements

- **Client Support for User Code Deployment**: You can now perform dynamic class loading from Hazelcast clients too.
- **Client Statistics in Management Center**: Hazelcast Management Center shows client statistics.
- **OpenSSL Integration**: OpenSSL is integrated into Hazelcast.
- **Filtering and Projection Support for MapPartitionIterator**: Purpose of this enhancement is to allow Hazelcast Jet to perform filtering and projections on IMap.
- **Fine-Grained Anti-Entropy Mechanism**: Allows to detect inconsistencies for each data structure in a single partition and replicate only the specific fragment of it instead of the whole partition.
- **Offloadable and Readonly entry processors**: These interfaces introduces in order to significantly improve entry processors' throughput.
- **Gigantic Cache Migration Enhancements**: It enables manual control on the partition migrations. Partitions can be migrated/replicated in small fragments. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9/manual/html/System_Properties.html" target="_blank">hazelcast.partition.migration.fragments.enabled</a> system property and <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Management/Cluster_Utilities/Managing_Cluster_and_Member_States.html" target="_blank">NO_MIGRATION</a> cluster state.
- **Keeping JCache Implementation Updated**: Hazelcast JCache implementation is updated for JSR 1.1 compliance when it is released.
- **Storing Near Cache Keys by Reference**: This enhancement provides a functionality to skip the serialization of keys for Near Caches to improve the performance of the Near Caches.
- **Client Connection Strategy Enhancements**: Allows lazy initiation for Hazelcast Clients.
- **All Statistics as JMX Beans**: All statistics shown on the Hazelcast Management Center  are now available as JMX beans.
- **Default Group Password and Symmetric Encryption Default Credentials Policy**: Hazelcast requires the default group password and default symmetric encryption password/salt to be changed.
- **Hazelcast Consistency Model Documentation**: We added a new chapter explaining the full picture of Hazelcast's consistency model.



The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- The attribute `override-java-serialization` should be added to the element `global-serializer` in `hazelcast-client-config.xsd`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10449" target="_blank">[#10449]</a>
- Hazelcast should have a method like `gerOrCreateHazelcastInstance()` to detect a default configuration file and either create an instance or get an existing one. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10007" target="_blank">[#10007]</a>
- Allow binding any port without using the method `setPortAutoIncrement()` and specifying the port count. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9775" target="_blank">[#9775]</a>
- Consistent interface for IMap and TransactionalMap is needed. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8729" target="_blank">[#8729]</a>
- Hazelcast instance's name should be added as a prefix to the name of the threads managed by Hazelcast. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8542" target="_blank">[#8542]</a>
- When back pressure is enabled members always use back-off and clients always throws `HazelcastOverloadedException`. This is not consistent and the behavior should be configurable on both members and clients. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8533" target="_blank">[#8533]</a>
- For `OperationService`, the contention on the counters should be reduced. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4925" target="_blank">[#4925]</a>
- Some of the properties mentioned in `GroupProperties` are not used anymore, it should be cleaned up. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4505" target="_blank">[#4505]</a>
- When a grid member is configured to use port 0, it should be handled properly. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2506" target="_blank">[#2506]</a>


## Fixes

The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.9-EA release.

- The system property `hazelcast.cache.invalidation.batchfrequency.seconds` does not work for IMap. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10743" target="_blank">[#10743]</a>
- When a Java application is run with Hazelcast 3.8.2 within Docker, and after switching from `openjdk:8u121-jre-alpine` to `openjdk:8u131-jre-alpine`, `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown during cluster bootstrap. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10704" target="_blank">[#10704]</a>
- Scheduled task remains cancelled after migration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10603" target="_blank">[#10603]</a>
- New cache eviction is populated among nodes very slowly. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10470" target="_blank">[#10470]</a>
- WAN backup events are published twice. The `publishWanReplicationEventBackups` method is called in the `run` and `afterRun` method in the `PartitionWideEntryBackupOperation`. Elsewhere it is only called in `afterRun`. This needs to be checked but possibly the fix is just to remove the call in `run`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10457" target="_blank">[#10457]</a>
- Source parameter is null on `JCache.loadAll()` call. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10328" target="_blank">[#10328]</a>
- `TcpIpJoiner` throws the exception`ConcurrentModificationException: null`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10207" target="_blank">[#10207]</a>
- It seems like the Near Cache statistics seem to be off-by-one for at least the `ownedEntryCount`. Sometimes the `ownedEntryMemoryCost` seems to be affected as well. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10193" target="_blank">[#10193]</a>
- Setting up a Hazelcast listener in a Spring configuration format does not seem to work when using the class property of `hz:listener`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10154" target="_blank">[#10154]</a>
- Test coverage for `NearCacheClientCacheProxy` should be increased. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10127" target="_blank">[#10127]</a>
- Hazelcast XML configuration does not allow `RANDOM` eviction as an eviction policy. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10053" target="_blank">[#10053]</a>
- There is a race condition in `TestClientRegistry` where the tests are calling `blockFrom` and `blockTo` before any connection was made (via `createSocketConnection`). This causes `NullPointerException` in those block methods. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10021" target="_blank">[#10021]</a>
- When health check is enabled, the user can send a garbage request like `http://<your member's host IP>:5701/hazelcast/healthqqq` and it returns a correct response. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9967" target="_blank">[#9967]</a>
- Durable Executor Service re-executes the completed tasks in case of a member failure. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9965" target="_blank">[#9965]</a>
- The option `cache-local-entries` is not supported at the client side Near Cache configuration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9712" target="_blank">[#9712]</a>
- Latest member-list may not be received when `FinalizeJoinOperation` invocation timeouts. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9501" target="_blank">[#9501]</a>
- Cluster member-list update operations are not ordered, new member addition and removal operations can get reordered on receiving/processing side. Also periodic member-list publish operation has no order with other member adding/removing operations. That can cause having different member lists on different members. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9486" target="_blank">[#9486]</a>
- Backup is lost if `maxIdle` property is used. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9153" target="_blank">[#9153]</a>
- Heartbeat only removes a member if it is related to the master member. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5253" target="_blank">[#5253]</a>
