### New Features and Changes

The following are the new features and changes introduced with 2.3 release.

- Changed `hazelcast.max.operation.timeout` unit from seconds to milliseconds.
- Added `hazelcast.max.concurrent.operation.limit` property to be able to limit the number of concurrent operations that can be submitted to Hazelcast.
- Added `hazelcast.backup.redo.enabled` property to enable/disable redo for backup operations.
- Added MultiMap and Distributed ExecutorService statistics to Management Center application.
- `MigrationListener` has now an additional method to receive failed migration events; `void migrationFailed(MigrationEvent migrationEvent)`.
- `ItemEvent` has now an additional method returning Member firing that event; `public Member getMember()`.
- Improved out of memory (OOM) error detection and handling. Now it is possible to register a custom hook when OutOfMemoryError is thrown.
- Fixed some issues related to domain name handling and networking/join.
- During cluster merge after a network split-brain, merging side will now fire MERGING and MERGED before and after RESTARTING and RESTARTED LifecycleEvents.

### Fixes


The following are the fixed issues and enhancements for 2.3 release.

- Operation exceptions occur randomly while the SQL predicates are stress tested. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/263" target="_blank">[263]</a>
- `EOF` exception is thrown in Management Center. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/252" target="_blank">[252]</a>
- The method `IMap.flush()` delegates map store exceptions to the caller instead of suppressing them. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/250" target="_blank">[250]</a>
- Node appears to be in multiple clusters. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/247" target="_blank">[247]</a>
- It would be nice to have Spring support in Runnable tasks. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/244" target="_blank">[244]</a>
- MERGING and MERGED events should be fired during a split-brain merging process. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/241" target="_blank">[241]</a>
- A problem occurs during a quick restart of master node. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/235" target="_blank">[235]</a>
- Distributed `tryLock()` throws `NullPointerException` from lite member. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/233" target="_blank">[233]</a>
- Using domain instead of IP address is problematic. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/230" target="_blank">[230]</a>
- The method `MultiMap.lock()` blocks forever. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/228" target="_blank">[228]</a>
- `SimpleMapTest` uses deprecated method `Hazelcast.getLoggingService()` and annoys WebLogic 12. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/227" target="_blank">[227]</a>
- `ItemEvent` should have a `getMember` method to return the member that offered/polled an item. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/226" target="_blank">[226]</a>
- The consumers do `queue.take()` and block until something is put on the queue. In Hazelcast 2.1.2, this was fine, but in 2.2, it causes a massive amount of WARN-level log spam. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/225" target="_blank">[225]</a>
- The method `MultiMap.put()` is inconsistent when the key is locked by another node/thread. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/223" target="_blank">[223]</a>
- FAILED event should be fired when migration fails for some reason. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/222" target="_blank">[222]</a>
- `Runtime` exception is thrown when accessing to queue after client restarted. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/220" target="_blank">[220]</a>
- Using the client, once it tries to access the cache while the cache is unavailable, the client cannot be used anymore after the server cache becomes available. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/218" target="_blank">[218]</a>
- The methods `DistributedTask.get()` and `MultiTask.get()` throw `OperationTimeoutException`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/217" target="_blank">[217]</a>
- There are a couple of classes that do not implement `toString`, that makes the `Config.toString` message incomplete. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/209" target="_blank">[209]</a>
- Hazelcast IMap ignores the size capacity. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/188" target="_blank">[188]</a>
- Hazelcast resource adapter package (version 2.1.2) does not deploy on JBoss 7.1.1. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/182" target="_blank">[182]</a>
