# 3.8-EA

This section lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for 3.8-EA (Early Access) release.

## New Features

The following are the new features introduced with 3.8 release.

- **Continuous Query Cache**: With this release, the previously Enterprise feature Continuous Query Cache becomes open source. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#continuous-query-=cache" target="_blank">Continuous Query Cache section</a>.
- **Rolling Member Upgrades for Minor Releases**: You can upgrade your Hazelcast members to the next minor release without service interruption. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#rolling-member-upgrades" target="_blank">Rolling Member Upgrades chapter</a>.
- **Restore Hot Restart Data in a Different Cluster**: You will be able to restore Hot Restart data on a completely new cluster with different IP addresses or on a cluster of machines formed by existing and new IP addresses. Since this is a removal of a restriction or limitation, nothing will change for current Hot Restart Store users. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#moving-copying-hot-restart-data" target="_blank">Moving/Copying Hot Restart Data section</a>.


## Enhancements


The following are the enhancements introduced with 3.8 release.

- **Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache Adapter**: Hot Cache functionality based on Striim's Change Data Capture (CDC) for the underlying database updates. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#hazelcast-striim-hot-cache" target="_blank">Hazelcast Striim Hot Cache section</a>.
- **Hot Restart Usability Improvements**: When a cluster with Hot Restart enabled is restarted, it starts in the ACTIVE state. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#hot-restart-types" target="_blank">Hot Restart Types section</a>.
- **Hot Restart with Incomplete Members**: The restart procedure for a cluster having Hot Restart enabled is now more flexible by allowing you to do a partial start, which basically means that once the cluster is shutdown, it can be restarted with some missing members. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#partial-start" target="_blank">Partial Start section</a>.
- **Copy Hot Restart Store data from Source to Target**: You can copy Hot Restart Store data from a running cluster to a target without shutting down the source cluster. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#hot-backup" target="_blank">Hot Backup section</a>.
- **Cluster Split-Brain Protection for Queue and Lock**: Split-brain protection is now available for the queue and lock data structures. Please refer to the sections <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#split-brain-protection-for-lock" target="_blank">Lock Split-Brain Protection</a> and <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#split-brain-protection-for-queue" target="_blank">Queue Split-Brain Protection</a>.
- **Eventually Consistent Near Cache**: With this improvement, possible losses of invalidation events are detected and stale reads are prevented. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#near-cache-eventual-consistency" target="_blank">Near Cache Eventual Consistency section</a>.
- **Fast Aggregations for Queries**: Please refer to <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#fast-aggregations" target="_blank">Fast Aggregations section</a>.
- **Projections for Queries**: Please refer to <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#projections" target="_blank">Projections section</a>.
- **Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore**: Implemented for the Ringbuffer which is similar to the existing queue store mechanism. Please refer to <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#ringbuffer-with-persistent-datastore" target="_blank">Ringbuffer with Persistent Datastore section</a>.
- **Unified Near Cache Implementation**: Different near cache implementations for JCache, map, client side and member side are unified. You can refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#near-cache" target="_blank">Near Cache section</a>.
- **Improvement in WAN Queue Full Behavior**: Now, Hazelcast throws an exception when the queue is full and replication is active, unless it is stopped on the Management Center. Please refer to <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.8-EA/manual/html-single/index.html#queue-full-behavior" target="_blank">Queue Full Behavior section</a>.

The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- It would be nice to have names assigned to all threads created by Hazelcast (and not the default ones, e.g., `pool-2-thread-1`, `pool-2-thread-2`). <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9210" target="_blank">[9210]</a>
- There should be a more detailed and clarifying information in the diagnostics of `PartitionIteratingOperation`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8855" target="_blank">[8855]</a>
- When there is no access to `NodeEngine`, the logger should be able to be used from a static context without any side effects to the logging configuration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8760" target="_blank">[8760]</a>
- Client tasks should be bounced back when a member has not completely start yet. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8715" target="_blank">[8715]</a>
- Currently the property `com.hazelcast.map.impl.eviction.ExpirationManager.PERIOD` is hard-coded to 5 seconds. Making it a configurable property will help in tuning the eviction. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8277" target="_blank">[8277]</a>
- The method `com.hazelcast.topic.impl.TopicProxy#publish` serializes the message even if the message is never sent due to having no subscribers. In the case of non-global-ordering and non-client use, the implementation should defer serialization until it has established that there are subscribers. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8262" target="_blank">[8262]</a>
- Configuration setting for WAN replication queue should be only for primary entries. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7124" target="_blank">[7124]</a>
- Currently if you want to use Container-Managed Transactions with Hazelcast within a JEE Application Server, you need to use the provided JCA Adapter. This JCA Adapter creates a Hazelcast instance. This should be allowed: configuration of the JCA Adapter to be either Server or Client-based. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5667" target="_blank">[5667]</a>
- Currently `PartitionIteratingOperation` consumes a generic operation thread, while the operations for the partitions are running. This means that the generic thread pool can dry out and this can cause a lot of problems for important tasks that cannot be executed since the thread pool is empty. A `PartitionIteratingService` should be introduced where the system can lookup TraceableOperations. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4889" target="_blank">[4889]</a>



## Fixes

The following are the issues solved for Hazelcast 3.8 release.

- Hazelcast 3.7.3 and Spring Boot 1.4.2 get the error `PortableFactory[-22] is already registered`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9353" target="_blank">[9353]</a>
- Problems with timeout in blocking calls. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9250" target="_blank">[9250]</a>
- Client protocol cannot handle "null"s in the collection. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9240" target="_blank">[9240]</a>
- Callback for time to live (for map eviction) is invoked with a significant delay. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8894" target="_blank">[8894]</a>
- "Warning 2" in `IMap::tryRemove` method's code comments is not correct. This method returns only a boolean. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8884" target="_blank">[8884]</a>
- When clients lose connection to the members in the cluster, even after the clients are reconnected to the cluster, the Entry/Message Listeners are never fired again. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8847" target="_blank">[8847]</a>
- Fixed `max-size` value behavior for Near Cache configuration. If you set 0 for the `max-size`, now, it is valued as `Integer.MAX_VALUE` as expected and documented. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/pull/8826" target="_blank">[8826]</a>
- Spring XML configuration: The smart routing attribute defaults to false while the documentation says it defaults to true. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8746" target="_blank">[8746]</a>
- In Hazelcast 3.6.3, the error `Current thread is not owner of the lock` shows up when using Hazelcast client to perform the actions. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8730" target="_blank">[8730]</a>
- Bulk `get` operation with 100 keys fails. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8535" target="_blank">[8535]</a>
- Member attributes go missing after merging from a split-brain scenario. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7697" target="_blank">[7697]</a>
- The method `setEvictionPolicy` for near cache configuration wants a string argument whereas the same for map configuration wants an enum value. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/2010" target="_blank">[2010]</a>


## Removed/Deprecated Features

- Aggregators feature is deprecated. Instead, Fast-Aggregations feature should be used.
