# 3.7-RC

This section lists the fixed issues for 3.7-RC release.

- Commit failure on clients sets the transaction state to ROLLING_BACK, which makes the transaction non-rollbackable. This is not a problem for lock-based data structures (map, multimap, etc.) but it is problematic for collections. State of the transaction should be changed to COMMIT_FAILED rather than ROLLING_BACK upon a commit failure. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8483" target="_blank">[8483]</a>
- `MapAttributeConfig` cannot be loaded in an OSGi environment. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8482" target="_blank">[8482]</a>
- Using Hazelcast out of the box with no configuration creates a Peer-to-Peer cluster. As soon as the configuration file `hazelcast.xml` is created by the user, in which only the logging type is set, Hazelcast does not create a cluster but starts in standalone mode. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8481" target="_blank">[8481]</a>
- Portable EntryProcessor is not being called on portable objects. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8365" target="_blank">[8365]</a>
- In Hazelcast Hibernate modules, there is no JCache dependencies in the classpath. When Hazelcast is upgraded to 3.7-SNAPSHOT, `java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError: javax/cache/Cache` error is thrown when mocking HazelcastInstance. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8352" target="_blank">[8352]</a>
- The method `QueryableEntry.serializationService` throws `NullPointerException` when MapReduce is run with extractable entries. Mapping phase of the MapReduce for Portable data formats should be fixed.  <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8346" target="_blank">[8346]</a>
- There is an error when configuring Replicated Map. The return of the method `getConfig` in `ReplicatedMapMBean` should be fixed.  <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8298" target="_blank">[8298]</a>
- TransactionalMap's `removeIfSame` test fails. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8238" target="_blank">[8238]</a>
- Distributed Executor Service does not take `ExecutorConfig.isStatisticsEnabled` into account. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8223" target="_blank">[8223]</a>
- Using `MapStoreConfig` in a cluster raises the exception `Transition not allowed from state NOT_LOADED to LOADED`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8196" target="_blank">[8196]</a>
- The method `IMap.size()` reports a stale result when blocked by the initialization of  `MapStore`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7905" target="_blank">[7905]</a>
- Programmatic configuration of logging for Hazelcast client does not work. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7764" target="_blank">[7764]</a>
- All JMX Beans disappear when the single Hazelcast instance is shut down in the same JVM. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7467" target="_blank">[7467]</a>
