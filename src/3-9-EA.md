# 3.9-EA

This section lists the fixed issuesfor 3.9-EA (Early Access) release.


- The system property `hazelcast.cache.invalidation.batchfrequency.seconds` does not work for IMap. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10743" target="_blank">[#10743]</a>
- When a Java application is run with Hazelcast 3.8.2 within Docker, and after switching from `openjdk:8u121-jre-alpine` to `openjdk:8u131-jre-alpine`, `IllegalArgumentException` is thrown during cluster bootstrap. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10704" target="_blank">[#10704]</a>
- Performance Issue in Hazelcast 3.8.1: `QueueStore.loadAll()` is called way too often when draining items from Queue. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10621" target="_blank">[#10621]</a>
- Scheduled task remains cancelled after migration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10603" target="_blank">[#10603]</a>
- New cache eviction is populated among nodes very slowly. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10470" target="_blank">[#10470]</a>
- WAN backup events are published twice. The `publishWanReplicationEventBackups` method is called in the `run` and `afterRun` method in the `PartitionWideEntryBackupOperation`. Elsewhere it is only called in `afterRun`. This needs to be checked but possibly the fix is just to remove the call in `run`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10457" target="_blank">[#10457]</a>
- Source parameter is null on `JCache.loadAll()` call. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10328" target="_blank">[#10328]</a>
- `TcpIpJoiner` throws the exception`ConcurrentModificationException: null`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10207" target="_blank">[#10207]</a>
- It seems like the Near Cache statistics seem to be off-by-one for at least the `ownedEntryCount`. Sometimes the `ownedEntryMemoryCost` seems to be affected as well. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10193" target="_blank">[#10193]</a>
- Setting up a Hazelcast listener in a Spring configuration format does not seem to work when using the class property of `hz:listener`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10154" target="_blank">[#10154]</a>
- Test coverage for `NearCacheClientCacheProxy` should be increased. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10127" target="_blank">[#10127]</a>
- Fast Aggregations for `any` operator on empty arrays do not work. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10126" target="_blank">[#10126]</a>
- Hazelcast XML configuration does not allow `RANDOM` eviction as an eviction policy. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10053" target="_blank">[#10053]</a>
- There is a race condition in `TestClientRegistry` where the tests are calling `blockFrom` and `blockTo` before any connection was made (via `createSocketConnection`). This causes `NullPointerException` in those block methods. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10021" target="_blank">[#10021]</a>
- When health check is enabled, the user can send a garbage request like `http://<your member's host IP>:5701/hazelcast/healthqqq` and it returns a correct response. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9967" target="_blank">[#9967]</a>
- Durable Executor Service re-executes the completed tasks in case of a member failure. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9965" target="_blank">[#9965]</a>
- The option `cache-local-entries` is not supported at the client side Near Cache configuration. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9712" target="_blank">[#9712]</a>
- Latest member-list may not be received when `FinalizeJoinOperation` invocation timeouts. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9501" target="_blank">[#9501]</a>
- Cluster member-list update operations are not ordered, new member addition and removal operations can get reordered on receiving/processing side. Also periodic member-list publish operation has no order with other member adding/removing operations. That can cause having different member lists on different members. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9486" target="_blank">[#9486]</a>
- Backup is lost if `maxIdle` property is used. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9153" target="_blank">[#9153]</a>
- Heartbeat only removes a member if it is related to the master member. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5253" target="_blank">[#5253]</a>
