This section lists the new features, enhancements, fixed issues and, removed or deprecated features for 3.9 release.

## New Features

The following are the new features introduced with 3.9 release.

##### Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Features

- **WAN Replication Using Discovery API**: With this new feature, you can run multiple clusters within  environments, that have Hazelcast's Discovery SPI implemented, without manually configuring IP addresses and use Hazelcast's WAN replication to keep them in sync. Please see the [Defining WAN Replication Using Discovery SPI section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9/manual/html/WAN_Replication/Defining_WAN_Replication.html#page_Defining+WAN+Replication+Using+Discovery+SPI).


##### Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Features

- **Dynamic Creation of Distributed Objects Configuration**: You can perform on the fly configuration of your distributed objects. Please see the [Dynamically Adding Configuration on a Cluster section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9/manual/html/Understanding_Configuration/Dynamically_Adding_Configuration_on_a_Cluster.html).



## Enhancements


The following are the enhancements introduced with 3.9 release.

##### Hazelcast IMDG Enterprise Enhancements


- **OpenSSL Integration**: OpenSSL is integrated into Hazelcast. Please see the [Integrating OpenSSL section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Security/Integrating_OpenSSL.html).


##### Hazelcast IMDG Open Source Enhancements

- **Client Support for User Code Deployment**: You can now perform dynamic class loading from Hazelcast clients too. Please see the [Client User Code Deployment section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Setting_Up_Clusters/Client_User_Code_Deployment_-_BETA.html).
- **Event Journal**: This new distributed data structure stores the history of mutation actions on data structures such as map or cache. Please see the [Event Journal section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Distributed_Data_Structures/Event_Journal.html).
- **Fine-Grained Anti-Entropy Mechanism**: Allows to detect inconsistencies for each data structure in a single partition and replicate only the specific fragment of it instead of the whole partition. Please see the [Consistency and Replication Model chapter](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Consistency_and_Replication_Model.html).
- **Offloadable and Readonly entry processors**: These interfaces introduced in order to significantly improve entry processors' throughput. Please see the [Entry Processor Performance Optimizations section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Distributed_Computing/Entry_Processor/Entry_Processor_Optimizations.html).
- **Gigantic Cache Migration Enhancements**: It enables manual control on the partition migrations. Partitions can be migrated/replicated in small fragments. Please refer to the <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/3.9-EA/manual/html/System_Properties.html" target="_blank">hazelcast.partition.migration.fragments.enabled</a> system property and <a href="http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Management/Cluster_Utilities/Managing_Cluster_and_Member_States.html" target="_blank">NO_MIGRATION</a> cluster state.
- **Storing Near Cache Keys by Reference**: This enhancement provides a functionality to skip the serialization of keys for Near Caches to improve the performance of the Near Caches. Please see the `serialize-keys` option in the [Near Cache section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Performance/Near_Cache/Configuring_Near_Cache.html).
- **Client Connection Strategy Enhancements**: Allows lazy initiation for Hazelcast Clients. Please see the [Configuring Client Connection Strategy section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Hazelcast_Clients/Java_Client/Configuration/Client_Connection_Strategy.html).
- **Default Group Password and Symmetric Encryption Default Credentials Policy**: Hazelcast requires the default group password and default symmetric encryption password/salt to be changed. Please see the [Validating Secrets Using Strength Policy section](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Security/Validating_Secrets_Using_Strength_Policy.html).
- **Hazelcast Consistency Model Documentation**: We added a new chapter explaining the full picture of Hazelcast's consistency model. Please see the [Consistency and Replication Model chapter](http://docs.hazelcast.org/docs/latest-development/manual/html/Consistency_and_Replication_Model.html).
- **Keeping JCache Implementation Updated**: Hazelcast JCache implementation is updated for JSR 1.1 compliance when it is released.



The following are the other improvements performed to solve the enhancement issues opened by the Hazelcast customers/team.

- There should be the ability to add a timeout to get operations for Spring `HazelcastCache`. [[#10756]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10756)

- The attribute `override-java-serialization` should be added to the element `global-serializer` in `hazelcast-client-config.xsd`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10449" target="_blank">[#10449]</a>
- Hazelcast should have a method like `gerOrCreateHazelcastInstance()` to detect a default configuration file and either create an instance or get an existing one. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10007" target="_blank">[#10007]</a>
- Allow binding any port without using the method `setPortAutoIncrement()` and specifying the port count. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9775" target="_blank">[#9775]</a>

- New cache eviction is populated among nodes very slowly. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10470" target="_blank">[#10470]</a>
- WAN backup events are published twice. The `publishWanReplicationEventBackups` method is called in the `run` and `afterRun` method in the `PartitionWideEntryBackupOperation`. Elsewhere it is only called in `afterRun`.

- Setting up a Hazelcast listener in a Spring configuration format does not seem to work when using the class property of `hz:listener`. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10154" target="_blank">[#10154]</a>
- Test coverage for `NearCacheClientCacheProxy` should be increased. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10127" target="_blank">[#10127]</a>

This causes `NullPointerException` in those block methods. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/10021" target="_blank">[#10021]</a>
- Client side query cache declarative configuration does not support wildcard usage `mapName` configuration. [[#9990]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9990)
- When health check is enabled, the user can send a garbage request like `http://<your member's host IP>:5701/hazelcast/healthqqq` and it returns a correct response. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9967" target="_blank">[#9967]</a>

- Latest member-list may not be received when `FinalizeJoinOperation` invocation timeouts. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9501" target="_blank">[#9501]</a>
- Cluster member-list update operations are not ordered, new member addition and removal operations can get reordered on receiving/processing side. Also periodic member-list publish operation has no order with other member adding/removing operations. That can cause having different member lists on different members. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9486" target="_blank">[#9486]</a>
- Hazelcast Client API (3.7.3) is not able to execute get/put/delete operations on the maps when used in AWS with smart-routing enabled (values and clear operation work). [[#9419]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9419)

- MultiMap lock: Thread is getting stuck when calling `lock(key)`. [[#9055]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/9055)
- Near Cache on the Hazelcast Client side returns old values. [[#8838]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/8838)
- Behavior of TTL when it is a negative value should be clarified. [[#7729]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/7729)
- Heartbeat only removes a member if it is related to the master member. <a href="https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/5253" target="_blank">[#5253]</a>
- Multicast discovery does not work after loading some data. [[#4721]](https://github.com/hazelcast/hazelcast/issues/4721)




## Behavioral Changes

- Maximum timeout of heartbeat for a member to assume it is dead was 300 seconds. Starting with Hazelcast 3.9, it is reduced to 60 seconds. Related property is `hazelcast.max.no.heartbeat.seconds`. Also, starting with Hazelcast 3.9, maximum timeout of master confirmation from other members is reduced to 150 seconds from 450 seconds. Related property is `hazelcast.max.no.master.confirmation.seconds`.

- Starting with Hazelcast 3.9, the format of member list shown in the logs is changed. Before Hazelcast 3.9, it was like the following:

  ```
  Members [3] {
      Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - c1ccc8d4-a549-4bff-bf46-9213e14a9fd2 this
      Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 33a82dbf-85d6-4780-b9cf-e47d42fb89d4
      Member [127.0.0.1]:5703 - 813ec82f-9d9e-4712-bae1-6c95b32d6d7d
  }
  ```
  
  Starting with Hazelcast 3.9, it is shown as follows:
  
  ```
  Members {size:3, ver:3} [
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5701 - e40081de-056a-4ae5-8ffe-632caf8a6cf1 this
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5702 - 93e82109-16bf-4b16-9c87-f4a6d0873080
    Member [127.0.0.1]:5703 - 06fb4e61-9757-443b-a19f-7af1f3966f30
  ]
  ```
  
  Here, you can see the size of your cluster (`size`) and member list version (`ver`). The member list version will be incremented when changes happen to the cluster, e.g., a member leaving from or joining to the cluster.
  
  You can set the system property `hazelcast.legacy.memberlist.format.enabled` to `true` if you want to see the member list in its old format.
